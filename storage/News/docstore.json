However, achieving the objectives of the IMF program is crucial to help Sri Lanka emerge from one of the most severe crises in its history.

She pointed out that key milestones had been achieved with the execution of domestic debt restructuring and agreements with the official creditor committee and EXIM Bank of China. \n\nHowever, she was careful to note that the IMF does not engage in direct negotiations between Sri Lanka and its creditors, instead offering an overall assessment of debt sustainability.\n\nKozack reiterated that while the IMF supports Sri Lanka\u2019s reform efforts, the timing of the Third Review will depend on the outcome of the upcoming elections. \u201cProgram discussions will resume after the elections, once a new government is in place,\u201d she stated.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71c6c93e-83ef-449e-89d5-8c76d8448d03": {"__data__": {"id_": "71c6c93e-83ef-449e-89d5-8c76d8448d03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "news 1.txt"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e8a149a4-865c-4b5f-821a-e992bea1d578", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "news 1.txt"}, "hash": "8d7d85e2903f2328e7cdfc17e16a14e1c5ca11227c90045d8fa12ab07ef3c39f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Jumbo threat to voters: election, wildlife authorities ready to deter elephants\nIn its bid to ensure that voters can reach polling stations safely on September 21, the election authorities have taken steps to liaise with the Department of Wildlife Conservation to prevent any threat from wild elephants, an official said.\nIn the electoral districts where human-elephant conflict prevails, the election authorities, as usual, fear whether voters will face any threat in reaching their respective polling stations located in the rural corners of the country.\nCommissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake told Daily Mirror that around 100 polling ststions in the Kurunegala electoral district face the threat of wild elephants.
