It is a massive social \ntransformation beyond the reformation of just one or two sectors \u2013 in essence, a \nrenaissance. It is the realization of the dream of a developed Sri Lanka that was stifled \nby corrupt regimes of the past. This is the dream of pioneering individuals produced by \nSri Lanka in the post-independence period in various fields, such as engineering, health, \neducation, art, literature, and human rights, who tried to lay solid foundations within those \nfields. Governance under the NPP will become a renaissance era because this dream that \nemerged in the twentieth century but was stifled and squandered can finally be realized in \nthe twenty-first century. \nDeveloping a production-based economy is our singular aim and guiding principle. \nFor this reason, many of our policies are focused on areas such as mineral resources, \ninformation and software technology, tourism industry, agriculture, marine resources, \nand creative industries (e.g., art, cinema, literature, music, theatre, etc.)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f875915c-2683-4193-91a5-a416bd4870e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f875915c-2683-4193-91a5-a416bd4870e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7d08aa6-a7e6-49d4-9124-49c57b7075d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "a714e5e40d4b69d307a2f082440820b6514001b24894c36d393231bd0360b199", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4177824f-e973-4e73-8a7f-7d890840d7ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "8aa950e813e7d6d16a0771323f879ebbc92dd82ebb41ee88aea432b657ff241a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33913cde-c1fd-4f31-a6fb-1bc53eb7cc88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a2a48c50f0dea096f81fc7aadcf9091adea49bed63dbc6811f2c77f9288c64b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is the realization of the dream of a developed Sri Lanka that was stifled \nby corrupt regimes of the past.

Governance under the NPP will become a renaissance era because this dream that \nemerged in the twentieth century but was stifled and squandered can finally be realized in \nthe twenty-first century. \nDeveloping a production-based economy is our singular aim and guiding principle. \nFor this reason, many of our policies are focused on areas such as mineral resources, \ninformation and software technology, tourism industry, agriculture, marine resources, \nand creative industries (e.g., art, cinema, literature, music, theatre, etc.)  that can utilize \nresources found within the country, be easily developed, and can be mobilized by the \nprofessional and trained labour resources we already have. Science and technology will be \nthe key players in our proposed production-based economy.  \nNPP regards education, health, and transportation as essential public services and plans \nto increase resource allocation in all these fields. We believe that education is a primary \nresponsibility of the government, and therefore, we commit to reducing the burden of \neducation placed on parents. Furthermore, efforts will be made to gradually eliminate the \ndisparity in education across the country resulting from the inequality in the distribution \nof resources. Vocational education will be mainstreamed as part of the national education \npolicy to fill the gap between education and the job market. We see vocational education as \na significant factor in developing the professionals needed to create a production economy.\nOur health policy focuses on increasing financial allocations to the public health sector \nto develop it as an effective public service. Further, we propose integrating the Western \nmedical system with the Indigenous and Ayurvedic medical systems currently practised \nin the country and providing a high-quality and effective healthcare service to the public. \nStrengthening the state share in public transport and creating an efficient public transport \nsystem in the country, regardless of whether it is day or night, is a cornerstone in the \nmultifaceted measures NPP plans to apply to the transport sector. We will move away from \n6\nanthropocentric thinking that places man as the sole owner of the earth, which conflicts \nwith nature and aims to co-exist with all elements of the environment to maintain the \nbalance of ecosystems. This foundation will support the realities of a systematic journey \nthat is required for the economy to become a circular economy. We plan for the energy \nsector to be based on renewable energy sources, agriculture to become a practice that does \nnot destroy ecosystems, and the construction industry to follow \u201cgreen\u201d practices. \n\u201cGahenu Api Eka Mitata\u201d is an exemplary women\u2019s movement that can be named as one \nof the biggest and most effective women\u2019s activist movements in Sri Lanka\u2019s history. The \ngoal of the NPP is to create a society where women, who represent half of the country\u2019s \npopulation, enjoy equal rights, free from physical, verbal and emotional violence. \nGuided by this vision, our priority will be to uphold and introduce laws in alignment \nwith international charters we have already signed and establish necessary protection \nmechanisms, leading to the transformation of attitudes and institutional changes. Our goal \nis to gradually increase the representation of women to 50% in all decision-making bodies, \nfrom Parliament to local government institutions. Apart from this, another important \nvision of the NPP is to produce a cultured human being. Under our government, we \nbelieve in the transformational power of turning those who currently lack heart, care, and \nwarmth\u2014who live mechanical lives and do not consider others\u2014into citizens who think \nof others, engage with art and philosophy, embrace humanity, and finally enjoy life. While \nthe current regime leaves the entire burden of cost-of-living on people, we, the NPP, will \nabsorb a substantial part of this responsibility into the government. Enhancing the quality \nof life and ease of living in a developed production economy will lay the foundation for \ncreating a cultured society. \nAn NPP government will be dedicated to eradicating the deeply entrenched corruption that \nhas plagued our political culture over the past 76 years and will work towards establishing a \nmore favourable and ethical political environment. Under our rule, reclaiming the wealth \nlooted by corrupt elite ruling groups will begin, ultimately returning this wealth to the \npeople. To achieve this, we will guide the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Police, and \nthe Attorney General\u2019s Department by enacting necessary laws and ensuring they operate \nwith full independence and authority.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3261, "end_char_idx": 8333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33913cde-c1fd-4f31-a6fb-1bc53eb7cc88": {"__data__": {"id_": "33913cde-c1fd-4f31-a6fb-1bc53eb7cc88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7d08aa6-a7e6-49d4-9124-49c57b7075d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "a714e5e40d4b69d307a2f082440820b6514001b24894c36d393231bd0360b199", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f875915c-2683-4193-91a5-a416bd4870e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "20f829d0aa49bac07bc7b02d0b326775c1064b3fda805c00ddd5692ee2b219df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8450b1f-bfec-460a-acaf-6a5efd9897be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5977f63b69d1ee679ed75e4be1fffb903918c853a9cd9584cd7e1bf0fe247854", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "While \nthe current regime leaves the entire burden of cost-of-living on people, we, the NPP, will \nabsorb a substantial part of this responsibility into the government.

To achieve this, we will guide the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Police, and \nthe Attorney General\u2019s Department by enacting necessary laws and ensuring they operate \nwith full independence and authority.\nCriminals will be held accountable as we will expose all information related to murders, \nincluding the Easter Sunday Attacks and the murders of journalists, sports figures, \nand targeted groups, which have been left unresolved. Additionally, we are committed \nto eradicating fraud and corruption at all levels\u2014from kickbacks and commissions to \nbribery\u2014whether in massive development projects or something as basic as enrolling a \nchild to school.\nFor the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s post-independence history, governance will shift from the \ncontrol of a few corrupt elite families to a people\u2019s government. From the presidency to \nevery representative body and operational mechanism in the country, all positions will be \nfree from elite family connections and will be filled by the children of ordinary citizens \nproduced through free education. An NPP government will usher in a new era of citizen \nactivism, collective intervention, social justice, and the application of good governance \nprinciples. The elitist relationship between rulers and the people that has existed since \nindependence will be replaced by a new social contract\u2014one of proud citizens and \nleaders who are friends of the people they serve. A fundamental step towards this goal \nis introducing a governmental structure where citizens can conduct their affairs without \nrelying on politicians. The NPP rejects the notion of a Prince Diyasen, King, or Hero who \n7\ncan single-handedly save the country. Instead, it views governance and development as \na collective effort. In this new system, less qualified political henchmen will be replaced \nby competent individuals appointed through a specific merit-based process, and these \ninstitutions will be allowed to function without political interference. The independence \nof the judiciary will be fully guaranteed, and protection and welfare mechanisms will be \nintroduced to safeguard various groups who may be susceptible to unfair treatment.\nThe NPP believes that Sri Lanka\u2019s underdevelopment and backwardness stem in large part \nfrom being isolated from the global community. We will actively promote fields such as \nscience and technology, research, education, culture, art, cinema, music, philosophy, and \nsports at the state, corporate, and individual levels. A key initiative of the NPP will be \nthe effort to build a unified Sri Lankan nation. The elite ruling class, which has governed \nthe country until now, failed to unite the Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and plantation \ncommunities under one flag as a Sri Lankan nation. Instead, they exacerbated conflicts \nbetween these groups to maintain their power. Our policies outline a range of material, \nstructural, and operational interventions to address this issue. We will create space for \nall ethnicities to envision a shared future as a unified Sri Lankan nation. It is our goal \nto involve all communities in the process\u2014from designing a production economy to \nensuring fair distribution of its benefits.\nWe invite all Sri Lankans who aspire to A Thriving Nation and a Beautiful Life to actively \njoin the NPP in building a people\u2019s government and collectively implementing our \nproposed policy program.\n8\n9\n01.\t\t\nA FULFILLING LIFE \n\t\n\t\nA COMFORTABLE COUNTRY\n1.1\t\nA civilized citizen- an advanced human resource\nIntroduction\nE\nducation is a cultural process that generates new knowledge by acquiring and \ndisseminating existing knowledge.

Only 35.4% of these students passed the GCE A/L examination \nand merely 12.7% secured university entrance.\nAnother significant problem is the disparity in the distribution of human and physical \nresources within the school system, which has led to a breakdown in parental trust in the \nsystem. According to the 2022 school census report, out of 10,126 schools, 1,473 (14.5%) \nhave fewer than 50 students, and 5,204 schools (51.4%) have fewer than 200 students. \nThis means that over half of the schools are underutilized and lack basic facilities. Only \n396 schools are classified as national schools, and just 2,959 schools (29%) offer GCE A/L \nsubject streams. The high cost of education that has to be borne by parents, despite the \npolicy of free education from the first year to the first degree, is another major concern.\nFurthermore, serious social criticism exists on the education system\u2019s failure to produce \nquality citizens. While education is not solely about preparing individuals for the job \nmarket, it should equip citizens to fulfil social responsibilities and contribute positively to \nthe national economy. The current mismatch between the education system and the needs \nof the main economic sectors, agriculture, industry, and service, is evident.\nThe NPP\u2019s education policy aims to provide quality education that fosters a developed, \nhumanistic, and responsible society. To achieve these goals, we will increase public \ninvestment in the education sector, gradually raising the allocation to education as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product up to 6%.\n10\nPrinciples\n\u25a0\t Free education and equal access\n\u25a0\t Relevance to human development and employment\n\u25a0\t Acceptability for all\n\u25a0\t Responsible citizens accountable to

The right to health is intrinsically linked to all other human rights. \nPatient empowerment is one of the key elements of patient-centred healthcare. Gender \ninequality remains a critical challenge in the health sector. Achieving Universal Health \nCoverage (UHC) is one of the world\u2019s nations\u2019 targets when adopting the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). All Sri Lankans have access to the full range of quality health \nservices they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It covers \nthe full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, \ntreatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. Therefore, it is the duty of the responsible \ngovernment to provide the most efficient evidence-based medical care to all citizens \nwithout delay. Quality healthcare systems include patient safety, timeliness, effectiveness, \nefficiency, equity and patient-centeredness. Safety and quality systems are integrated with \ngovernance processes to enable the Ministry of Health to actively manage and improve the \nsafety and quality of health care for patients. \nThe WHO\u2019s ranking of the world\u2019s health systems indicated that the Sri Lankan health \nsystem was 76 in the year 2000. According to the 2024 edition of the CEOWORLD \nmagazine\u2019s Health Care Index, Sri Lanka has been ranked as 105 globally. The WHO \nrecommends that government expenditure on health as a % of GDP should be, at least \n5%. Further, a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their expenditure on health \ncare out of pocket now. WHO further recommends that out-of-pocket expenditure on \nhealth should be less than 20%. But a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their \nexpenditure on health care out of pocket now. The reforms will require strengthening \nall aspects of the health system \u2013 financing, human resources, pharmaceuticals, and \ninformation systems \u2013 to meet the needs of a complex service  delivery system.\nPrinciples\n\u25a0\t The right of individuals to receive the benefits of the health care system with \nrespect and dignity.\n\u25a0\t The state\u2019s responsibility to provide

at least 3% of the GDP \nwithin a short period.\n\u25a0\t Utilize funds efficiently and transparently while actively combating corruption in \nthe health sector.\nDigital Health \n\u25a0\t Digitize

living\nIntroduction\nT\nhe housing issue in Sri Lanka, particularly in urban areas, has become increasingly \nsevere, especially for low-income families. In Colombo alone, approximately 65,000 \nhomes in low-income settlements are spread across 1,000 acres. Residents in these areas \nhave been largely neglected by previous governments and suffer from a lack of basic \namenities such as water, electricity, sanitation, and clean air. While other urban residents \ncan build, buy, or rent homes, varying income levels make these options challenging for \nmany. Government employees, in particular, struggle with the high cost of rent, as their \nincomes are often insufficient to cover these expenses.\nRural housing issues also persist, although they have received less attention from the \ngovernment. Even when families own land, they face problems such as unclear land \nownership, poor locations, lack of access roads, high costs of building materials, and \nunstable income levels, making it difficult to construct or maintain homes. Approximately \n2% of Sri Lanka\u2019s rural population lives in estate housing, primarily in the Central, Uva, \nSabaragamuwa, and Southern Provinces. Most of these estate worker communities reside \nin overcrowded line houses with minimal facilities. Significant social issues arise as the \nnumber of households within these communities increases. Despite having land, the low \nincomes of these families prevent them from building adequate homes, forcing them to \nlive under extremely poor conditions.\nOur goal is to construct multi-story housing complexes wherever possible, efficiently \nmanaging the limited land available and addressing the needs of the people.\nPrinciples\n\u25a0\t A healthy home for every individual\n\u25a0\t Effective land management\n\u25a0\t Comprehensive housing projects\nACTIVITIES\n\u2022\t Offering financial support to newly married couples for purchasing or constructing \ntheir homes.\nUrban Housing\n\u2022\t Encouraging the private sector to develop affordable housing projects in urban \nareas and providing appropriate land for these initiatives.\n\u2022\t Promoting investments from Sri Lankans living abroad in affordable housing \nprojects in urban areas.\n\u2022\t Implementing programs to provide official residences for government employees \nclose to their workplaces.\n22\n\u2022\t Facilitating the provision of affordable housing for residents of low-income \nsettlements in Colombo through government intervention.\n\u2022\t Developing comprehensive housing projects in urban and semi-urban areas, \nincluding essential facilities such as healthcare, education, sports, transportation, \nand parks.\nRural Housing\n\u2022\t Revising the relevant laws to address issues related to land ownership for housing \ndevelopment.\n\u2022\t Enhancing access roads to residential areas.\n\u2022\t Establishing housing loan schemes to support home constructions.\nEstate Housing\n\u2022\t Providing financial and infrastructural support to enhance housing, water and \nsanitation facilities for Malayagam communities.\n\u2022\t Allocating lands for Malayagam communities to construct permanent homes.\n\u2022\t Developing affordable housing schemes in areas surrounding estates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 33007, "end_char_idx": 37923, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1652fc73-3676-43a0-9a67-2a969dd68fa4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1652fc73-3676-43a0-9a67-2a969dd68fa4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7d08aa6-a7e6-49d4-9124-49c57b7075d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "a714e5e40d4b69d307a2f082440820b6514001b24894c36d393231bd0360b199", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "263fa66b-d217-473c-9ac2-8e6124e96a32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "f1ca22d5dedc3a9b11c38a81fcce6fbc8c525e28f6a9f8a426ecc1f000b5c6ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80fba26e-c224-4779-beff-4fbf2ff0f538", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d4b2f7d506dd2b653a8fe80c38a83398c6e97ed6545585937da881f119ff768", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022\t Promoting investments from Sri Lankans living abroad in affordable housing \nprojects in urban areas.\n\u2022\t Implementing programs to provide official residences for government employees \nclose to their workplaces.\n22\n\u2022\t Facilitating the provision of affordable housing for residents of low-income \nsettlements in Colombo through government intervention.\n\u2022\t Developing comprehensive housing projects in urban and semi-urban areas, \nincluding essential facilities such as healthcare, education, sports, transportation, \nand parks.\nRural Housing\n\u2022\t Revising the relevant laws to address issues related to land ownership for housing \ndevelopment.\n\u2022\t Enhancing access roads to residential areas.\n\u2022\t Establishing housing loan schemes to support home constructions.\nEstate Housing\n\u2022\t Providing financial and infrastructural support to enhance housing, water and \nsanitation facilities for Malayagam communities.\n\u2022\t Allocating lands for Malayagam communities to construct permanent homes.\n\u2022\t Developing affordable housing schemes in areas surrounding estates.\n1.4 \t\nAn Energetic Citizen - Triumphant People\nIntroduction\nS\nports play a crucial role not only in fostering participation and achieving victory but \nalso in shaping a healthy, disciplined, and intelligent society. Success in sports brings \nhonor and pride to the country, while participation promotes a healthier nation, creating \nindividuals with discipline, strong personality, and sound mental health.\nHowever, inefficient management and political interference have become significant \nbarriers to the growth of the sports sector.

cultural and artistic space is a highly sensitive area within a society. Though culture \nand art seem to take time to have an impact on the human community, the decline \nin these areas has caused a significant erosion in contemporary Sri Lankan society. The \nintentional destruction of the foundation of culture and arts has weakened civil society. \nSeveral past governments have neglected the cultural sector. The educational framework, \nwhich should have been effectively developed and maintained from early childhood, has \noften fallen victim to shifts in political power. As a result, society\u2019s failure to cultivate \na developed cultural life has led individuals to fall short of becoming complete and \nempowered citizens, even after progressing through stages such as preschool, school, \ntechnical college, and university. This failure has led to a loss of faith in the belief that \nculture is the root of human life.\nThis field of culture is shaped by the interplay of interconnected domains, including \neducation, art, media, and religious beliefs. The long-term decline of these areas has given \nrise to numerous social issues, such as excessive competition, restlessness, stress, suicides, \ndissatisfaction, violence, environmental neglect, and a diminished sense of dignity. \nSociety is now calling for a new vision that can swiftly address these wounds and bring \nabout essential changes. Such a transformation can only be realized through a robust \nrevitalization of the cultural sector, aimed at fostering a national revival. The National \nPeople\u2019s Power movement aspires to create a new cultural individual or cultured person \n\u2014one that is free, critical, respectful of human dignity, and embraces diverse cultures. \n25\nPrinciples\n\u25a0\t The right to preserve and develop the cultural identity of every community\n\u25a0\t The right of every community and individual to intervene in the development

In addition to this, it \nencompasses a marine zone of 18,060 square kilometres, a neighbouring marine zone \nof 19,620 square kilometres, and an extended economic zone of 437,400 square kilometres.\nAccording to the topography, the area up to 300 feet is classified as the coastal zone, while \nareas between 300 feet to 1,000 feet and above are categorized as mountainous regions. \nThe annual rainfall varies from 900 millimetres to over 5,000 millimetres. The primary \nriver systems are fed by 103 major rivers and 94 smaller rivers and streams. Due to the \ninterconnections among environmental systems, the entire land area of Sri Lanka can be \nconsidered a single ecosystem. The fertile soil layer and plant-animal species of which, \nabout 25% to 30% is identified endemic are unique features.\nDespite this, Sri Lanka has been unsuccessful in creating an environment-friendly and \neconomically developed society. For over 20 years, it has been unsuccessful in defining \nthe marine zone in the environmentally important continental pool under the exclusive \neconomic zone, which is more than 20 times larger than Sri Lanka. Despite being a signatory \nCountry to many of the international Conventions and Treaties and also having more \nthan 100 environmental laws in the country, it has failed to build up an environmentally \n31\nfriendly nation. Due to the lack of proper land-use planning, the land is turning into \nbarren land with soil erosion and landslides. The absence of proper water management \nhas caused severe water shortages and disasters from excess water as well.

Mass media represents \nthe modern state of this long-standing evolution. The term \u2018media\u2019 encompasses the \ntechnical methods, tools, institutions, technical procedures, organizational structures, \nand other elements used to disseminate various messages to the public. It is the means \nthrough which broad objectives such as information providing, education, persuasion, \nentertainment, social adaptation, cultural promotion, and mutual co-existence are \nachieved. The effectiveness of journalism relies on the integrity and quality of all these \ncomponents.\nThe media process should be tailored to the specific needs of a country, society, or \ncommunity. Therefore, policies and initiatives that establish its foundation are crucial. \nSince gaining independence in 1948, successive governments in Sri Lanka have used print \nand electronic media as the mechanism to maintain their power. Consequently, instead \nof delivering accurate, truthful, and clear news, the media in the country has increasingly \nfocused on promoting pro-government narratives, eulogies and personal biases. The \nchallenge is that news and feature programs filled with deception, misrepresentation, and \nbiased attitudes have fueled mistrust, suspicion, and conflict among ethnic groups. As \njournalists increasingly became political partisans more focused on profit and attention \nthan integrity, public trust in the media began to erode.\nThe NPP is committed to preventing the deliberate and strategic misuse of mass media. \n36\nBy positioning mass media, journalists, and the audience as catalysts for social, political, \neconomic, and cultural renewal, the NPP is dedicated to ensuring technical support and \nsafeguarding the professional integrity of journalists.\nPrinciples\n\u25a0\t The right of people to access truthful and accurate information\n\u25a0\t A media industry that is responsible and humanistic\n\u25a0\t Freedom and independence of the media\n\u25a0\t The media as a public asset\nACTIVITIES\n\u25a0\t Facilitating university journalism units and other rating institutions in \nstreamlining the mass media rating system based on the quality and popularity \nof news and programs.\n\u25a0\t Amending the 2024 No. 09 Online Safety Act by removing restrictions on freedom \nof expression.\n\u25a0\t Introducing new rating criteria, including language use, promotion of intercultural \nand interethnic harmony, education, and science promotion, and making these \nratings publicly available.\n\u25a0\t Reviewing existing media laws, regulations, agreements, and ethics with a focus \non media freedom to develop an optimal media policy.\n\u25a0\t Introducing a code of ethics for media institutions and journalists that aligns \nwith international standards and local social contexts.\n\u25a0\t Introducing programs to foster free and healthy competition in media by \nevaluating newspapers, radio and TV channels, media personnel, programs, \narticles, and photographs.\n\u25a0\t Organizing an awards ceremony to recognize media professionals across all \nsectors.\n\u25a0\t Providing low-interest loans to journalists for purchasing essential equipment, \nsuch as cameras.\n\u25a0\t Guiding state media institutions in upholding high standards of media ethics and \nexcellence.\n\u25a0\t Promoting media development, communication, and education programs to the \npublic.\n\u25a0\t Supporting artists and producers in achieving international recognition in fields \nsuch as cinema, television, and music.\n\u25a0\t Encouraging local companies and producers to create high-quality advertisements \nand promotional programs and enter international markets.\n\u25a0\t Implementing a systematic archival process for media creators and their works.\n\u25a0\t Promoting media literacy programs to foster an informed audience.\n\u25a0\t Establishing an independent media commission to oversee the optimal \nfunctioning of journalism process. \n37\n38\n 02.\t\t\nAn honourable life\n\t\n\t\nA safe country\n2.1 \t\nA safe society - An enriched nation\nIntroduction\nA\npproximately 5.7 million people in Sri Lanka live below the national poverty line (set \nat Rs. 16,326 per month as of May 2024 as confirmed by the Department of Census and \nStatistics.

A report published by the United Nations Development Programme indicates \nthat more than half of the population (55.7%), which is about 12.34 million people, are \nexposed to multidimensional poverty. This reflects a significant challenge: since gaining \nindependence, the political parties in power have left a social legacy where a substantial \nportion of the population remains poor and suffers from multidimensional vulnerabilities.\nSince independence, every government elected to power has implemented various social \nprotection and welfare programs aimed at alleviating poverty. While these programs \nprovide financial and/or livelihood support to the needy, these programmes suffer from \nseveral inherent weaknesses, such as inefficiency, high administrative costs, lack of \ntransparency in the selection of beneficiaries, failure to reach the intended recipients, \npolitical interference, and delays in payments etc. As a result, successive governments have \nfailed to provide adequate and strong social protection and welfare to those in need.\nThe NPP views social protection and welfare as a core responsibility of the state. Given \nthe current economic conditions where a significant portion of the population lacks \nemployment, business opportunities, and viable economic prospects, there is a pressing \nneed for a comprehensive social protection program to rebuild the economy and society. \nThe objective of the NPP\u2019s social protection and welfare programs is to improve the \nliving standards of those entitled to welfare benefits and to enable them to become active \nparticipants in the economy quickly.

As a result, most of the labor \nforce faces harsh experiences in their economic, social, and cultural lives.

Despite women being the primary earners of foreign remittances, the \nnecessary structural and ideological changes for equality and justice have not yet taken \nplace. Instead, the commodification of women\u2019s identities and their marginalization in the \nlabor market have intensified.\nOverall, factors such as the marginalization of both women and men as vulnerable workers, \nthe direct impact on women due to the weakening of public services like education and \nhealthcare, and the enactment of laws controlling women\u2019s bodies amidst militarization \nand ethno-religious extremism highlight women\u2019s issues as a broader social crisis. \nTherefore, the current issues faced by women in Sri Lanka must be understood through \nan intersectional perspective. The NPP proposes a political practice that represents \nall marginalized groups in society, aiming to realize the aspirations of a just society, a \nfree country, and free women by securing all rights. Hence, its policies on women are \nintrinsically linked to its other policies.\nGender identities and sexual orientations are diverse. However, in Sri Lanka, these groups \noften face violence, marginalization, and stigmatization. Additionally, outdated colonial \nlaws, institutional frameworks, and regressive cultural beliefs contribute to the denial of \njustice to these communities.

country\nIntroduction\nT\nhe quality of life and socio-cultural development of citizens of a country depends \non correct economic policies adopted and actions taken. The destructive economic \npolicies and corrupt political culture followed by the leaders of the country have left us \ntoday with a battered and crippled economy and society where human lives have been \nshattered in every aspect.\nThe total government debt, Rs. 310,779 million in 1990, increased to Rs. 28,695,950 \nmillion by 2023, pushing the entire nation into a debt trap. Between 2015 and 2019 alone, \nthe total debt increased by Rs. 13,031,543 million, reflecting a 74% increase. Additionally, \nthere was a staggering debt growth of 51.43% in 2022 compared to 2021. As of March \n31, 2024, the total public debt has reached Rs. 28,013,560 million, which exceeded USD \n100,000 million.\nHowever, due to the misappropriation of borrowed funds and the failure to invest them \nin economically productive projects, the economy did not grow in corresponding to the \nincrease in debt. The annual economic growth decreased from 5% to -0.2% between 2015 \nand 2019 and it was -2.3% in 2023.\nWeak tax administration, inefficiency, corruption, granting tax benefits to cronies, tax \navoidance, and tax evasion have led to a significant decline in government tax revenue \nas a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By December 2023, the total \ntax defaults alone exceeded Rs. 1,100,000 million. The government\u2019s stance has been to \nimpose more taxes on people, cut essential public expenditure, and sell off public assets \nwithout considering the negative consequences of the decline in the demand for goods \nand services and the disposable income of people.\nDespite continued rhetoric about controlling inflation, the reality is that the prices of \ngoods and services have risen to unaffordable levels. The ultimate result is that people\u2019s \nreal income has gone down so low that basic human needs cannot be fulfilled. As a result \nof destructive politics, about 26% of the population has been dragged below the poverty \nline.\nThe external sector of the economy also continues to weaken due to the arbitrary use of \nforeign reserves, weak foreign exchange management, the inability to refinance foreign \ndebt caused by the continuous downgrading of the credit rating of the country, the inability \nto attract foreign investment, rising import expenditure, and stagnant export earnings. \nEven foreign reserves at the end of May 2024 stood at USD 5.4 billion (including USD \n1.5 billion SWAP loan facilities provided by the People\u2019s Bank of China), it was mainly an \noutcome of unpaid interest, debt instalments in arrears, import restrictions, remittances \nfrom overseas Sri Lankans, and receipt of IMF extended fund facility, rather than a result \nof proactive and sustainable measures of the government. \n56\nInequality in income distribution has also been widening. The bottom 20% of households \nreceive only 4.6% of the national income, while the top 20% get 51.4% of the income.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 103972, "end_char_idx": 108561, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "652a2a2e-462b-4034-8934-8938b0289b81": {"__data__": {"id_": "652a2a2e-462b-4034-8934-8938b0289b81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7d08aa6-a7e6-49d4-9124-49c57b7075d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "a714e5e40d4b69d307a2f082440820b6514001b24894c36d393231bd0360b199", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dff642af-99b5-416d-abd7-0a357c6b97b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "29c7cdbf78d2bc76249543cff07b7a769ef9818668ed019f7a696de8b838d87f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16388610-330e-44b3-84e0-4e74a0f86480", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c4dc76dceb446489d8586027674ca6a78a4b7eae24854994a2d90be79e35fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Even foreign reserves at the end of May 2024 stood at USD 5.4 billion (including USD \n1.5 billion SWAP loan facilities provided by the People\u2019s Bank of China), it was mainly an \noutcome of unpaid interest, debt instalments in arrears, import restrictions, remittances \nfrom overseas Sri Lankans, and receipt of IMF extended fund facility, rather than a result \nof proactive and sustainable measures of the government. \n56\nInequality in income distribution has also been widening.

productivity - Nation with food security\nIntroduction\nC\nurrently, the agricultural sector contributes 8.4% to GDP, while employment in this \nsector accounts for approximately 27%. Additionally, 15.3% of export revenue is \ngenerated from agricultural crops. This highlights the significant role agriculture plays in \nSri Lankan society.\nWith rapid population growth, traditional technologies alone became insufficient to \nproduce the required amount of food for the population, prompting Sri Lanka to adopt \nmodern technological methods. These efforts enabled the country to meet the target of \nproducing 2.4 million metric tons of rice necessary for the population. However, some \nshortsighted policies implemented during past administrations have challenged domestic \nrice production. Farmers struggle to receive a fair price for their harvests, while consumers \nfind purchasing preferred rice varieties at affordable prices difficult.\nIncreasing the production of high-quality vegetables and fruits has become a challenge, \nwith approximately 30% of the total vegetable and fruit production being lost post-\nharvest. Looking at the other field crop sector, the country spent about USD 400 million \non imports in 2022 alone. Additionally, the production of foreign exchange-earning crops \nsuch as tea, coconut, rubber, export-oriented crops, and specialty crops has declined. The \nwrong agricultural policies and actions of past governments, along with the failure to \nadopt appropriate technologies, have contributed to these issues.\nAs a result, the current agriculture sector in Sri Lanka faces several major challenges, \nincluding subsistence farming, minimal mechanization, high production costs, insufficient \nprices for production, high prices and price volatility of agricultural products, weak \nextension services, inadequate value addition, and low youth participation. This agricultural \npolicy has been formulated after carefully considering the prevailing conditions, and it is \nexpected that its implementation will yield an income of approximately LKR 3 million \nper acre annually. The policy aims to exceed 400 million metric tons in national tea \nproduction, increase the yield per coconut tree to 80 coconuts per annum, raise the rubber \nyield to 1,300 kilograms per hectare per year, and achieve a paddy yield of 6 metric tons \nper hectare.\nPrinciples\n\u25a0\t National food and nutrition security\n\u25a0\t High productivity and efficiency in agricultural

\nIntroduction\nT\nhe livestock sector plays a vital role in providing essential proteins and other nutrients \nto the people of Sri Lanka. Additionally, it significantly strengthens the national \neconomy and improves livelihoods through import substitution. The sustainability of the \nlivestock industry depends on factors such as production capacity, the number of livestock \nfarms, infrastructure, the labour force, and the availability of policymakers, administrators, \nresearchers, and other stakeholders.\nHowever, livestock production in Sri Lanka has not yet reached the desired levels, and \nthe sector faces numerous challenges. These include severe shortages of quality animal \nfood and breeding materials, high prevalence of animal diseases, weak supply chains and \nservices related to production, unethical and imbalanced markets, lack of organized value \nchain developments and proper livestock extension programs, inadequate health services, \npoor management of breeding activities, minimal research interventions, limited access to \ncredit and insurance facilities, and insufficient incentives and guidance for stakeholders. \nThese challenges contribute to the inefficiency within Sri Lanka\u2019s livestock

related products recognized as a high-quality, safe source of protein. \nTherefore, it is a national priority to strengthen fisheries and aquaculture to meet the \ncountry\u2019s demand for fish. Fisheries, aquaculture, and related industries can also contribute \nto sectors such as gross domestic production, food security, job creation, uplifting the \nsocio-economic status of people, and earning foreign exchange.\nThe fisheries in Sri Lanka can be divided into main categories: seawater fisheries \nand freshwater fisheries and the aquaculture industry. The ocean region of Sri Lanka \nencompasses a unique economic zone of 517,000 square kilometers. It also consists of \na local waterbody of 21,500 square kilometers, lagoons and estuaries covering 1,580 \nsquare kilometers, and reservoirs spanning 5,200 square kilometers. Currently, around \n225,000 individuals in Sri Lanka engage in seawater fisheries, while approximately 90,650 \nare involved in freshwater fisheries. In the year 2000 the fisheries and related industries \ncontributed 2.7%. to the country\u2019s GDP.  But this has now decreased to 1.2%. Our annual \nper capita fish consumption, which was 17.2 kilograms in 2017, has now declined to 11.07 \nkilograms. This trend has adversely affected the health of people, especially children and \npregnant mothers.\nThe fisheries and aquaculture sectors are currently facing many issues. Among them, the \nhigh expenditure on fuel and other resources, the government\u2019s lack of interventions to \nintroduce better technology and techniques, illegal fishing activities by foreign vessels, \nan outdated legal framework and processes, and insufficient incentives for sustainable \nand eco-friendly techniques are the primary concerns. The main aims of this policy \nframework include the development and management of the fisheries in a sustainable and \neco-friendly manner through proper scientific techniques and practical methods, thereby \nincreasing fish products and making them available to consumers at a reasonable price, as \nwell as uplifting the living standards of those engaged in fisheries.\nPrinciples\n\u2022\t Fish

However, subject fields in Sri Lanka\u2019s education \nsystem are evolving too slowly to meet the global IT industry\u2019s demands, leading to a skill \ngap. Additionally, investment opportunities to launch modern Research and Development \n(R&D) and Technology sectors are limited. High energy costs, uncertainty in supply, weak \ninternet infrastructure, insufficient public transportation, and unstable state policies and \neconomic conditions further hinder industry growth.\nThe global ICT market, valued at USD 9,039 billion in 2024, is rapidly expanding, with \na projected growth rate of 11.0% by 2028, presenting significant opportunities for Sri \nLanka\u2019s ICT industry. Emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and cybersecurity pave the \nway for innovation. Freelancing and remote work allow Sri Lankan ICT professionals to \ncollaborate with global clients.\nCurrently, Sri Lanka\u2019s ICT sector employs 85,000 professionals and generates USD 1.2 \nbillion in annual foreign exchange earnings. Our goal is to position Sri Lanka as a global \nleader in high-quality ICT products and solutions and to establish the country as a hub for \ninternational partnerships.

Even the limited research conducted in Sri Lanka have not been used \nproperly for economic and social development. \nSri Lanka possesses many resources, including endemic flora and fauna species with \nhigh biodiversity and herbal value, geological resources, the sea surrounding the island, \nfreshwater resources within the country, balanced soil, tropical climate, year-round solar \npower, wind power, and rivers and lakes with much potential. All these elements can be \nused to produce value-added products and services with lower costs, giving higher profits, \nand they carry a huge potential in the international market.\nSri Lanka is rich with intelligent human resources, and many innovators are emerging even \nat the village level, but a mechanism to extract their ideas and innovations or to provide \nthe necessary infrastructure occurred at a minimum level. In the future, Sri Lanka can be \nturned into an innovation centre by providing resources and the correct environment to \nharness this human potential.

Moreover, these countries generated export revenues of USD 59 billion, USD \n384 billion, and USD 808 billion, respectively, whereas Sri Lanka\u2019s merchandise export \nrevenue was just USD 17.3 billion. This disparity highlights Sri Lanka\u2019s critical challenge \nin goods and services production, which stems from the lack of a comprehensive plan to \nenhance production capabilities and the failure to leverage advanced global technologies \nfor productive growth.\nTherefore, we consider Sri Lanka must enhance local production and transition to an \nexport-driven economy to navigate the current economic crisis successfully. This requires \na comprehensive short and long-term industrial development plan that leverages the \ncountry\u2019s strategic location, inclusive human capital, and natural resources, supported by \ncommitted political leadership. The primary objectives of this policy framework include \nrevitalizing collapsed local industries, boosting the competitiveness of export industry \nsectors, promoting service industries, tapping into

The peninsular basin, which is about twenty times \nthe land area and including the ocean region which will be nominally granted according \nto the UN ocean laws, is also rich in ocean minerals. Varieties of ores of minerals such as \ngraphite, mica, apatite, lime and dolomite, mineral sand, quartz and silica sand, feldspar, \nserpentine, laterite, different clay types, and gems which had been created because of \ndifferent geological factors are abundantly found in Sri Lanka. Many industries such as \nmineral sand, cement, phosphate, ceramic, glass, and roof tiles were originated from \nmineral resources discovered through the mineral resource expeditions in the 1980s. \nSince then, minerals have been sold as raw material without any value additions, and \nmany of these industries have either been sold out or closed by now.\nSri Lanka has been famous since ancient times as a country abundant with variety of \ngems. There is an immense potential to make Sri Lanka a main centre in the global gem \nmarket by capturing a considerable portion of the global gem market using the presence \nof individuals who possess both traditional and modern technologies about the gem \nindustry, the availability of university-level programmes, and the unique location of Sri \nLanka. However, Sri Lanka has been able to earn only USD 250 million a year from the \ngem and jewelry industry.

A secured energy centre - A sustainable revenue source\nIntroduction\nThe global energy sector is in the midst of atransformative era, driven by sustainability \nandinnovation.With evolving consumption patternsand regulatory frameworks, the shift \ntowardcleaner energy sources is accelerating. Electricitygeneration from solar and wind \nenergy, along withadvanced energy storage solutions, is growingrapidly, accelerated by \nglobal commitments toreduce greenhouse gas emissions and the fallingcosts of these \ntechnologies. Additionally, lowemission technologies such as green hydrogenandsmall \nmodular reactor technologies are gainingsignificant traction. Decreasing costs of \nbatteryproductionare catalysing the electrification of theglobal transportation sector. \nElectrification of allforms of energy consumption is seen as a vitalstrategy to achieve \n91\nnet-zero emission targets.In response to these trends,there is an urgentneed to rapidly \ntransform the electricity grid intoa smart grid.\nFossil fuels continue to play a significant rolein meeting global energy demands. There \nis anongoing,profound discussion about minimisingthe environmental impact of fossil \nfuel usage.Maintaining a strategic energy mix is crucialto navigating disruptions owing \nto geopoliticalconstraints. Natural gas, viewed as a cleaner andtransitional energy source, \nplays a key role inthe shift toward renewable energy. Internationalinvestments in Liquefied \nNatural Gas (LNG) andthe exploration of new natural gas reserves areexpanding, in \nresponse to its importance in theglobal energy landscape.\nAmidst these global trends, Sri Lanka remainsburdened with some of the highest \nelectricityprices in the region. To emerge from the economicabyss caused by decades of \nmismanagement,the country musttransition to a manufacturingeconomy. However, high \nelectricity prices pose asignificant obstacle. The primary reason for theelevated electricity \nprices is the heavy relianceon oil-based generation. Previous regimes, ratherthan making \ntimely investments in low-costenergy sources, repeatedly opted for short-termfixes by \ncontracting oil-based power stations.\nWe present the policy and action plan of theNational People\u2019s Power, which \nprioritisestransitioning to an energy mix that is the leastdependent on oil-based \nelectricity generation,with a significant increase in renewable energyto foster a green \neconomy. This policy includesstrategies to revive and enhance the ailingrefinery, national \nstorage and distributioninfrastructure for oil, ensuring an undisruptedenergy supply. \nWhile addressing these challenges,Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector will be transformedinto a \ncompetitive and transparent industry,equipped withmodern technology and focusedon \ncustomer empowerment. This comprehensivepolicy and action planaim to drive Sri \nLankatowards socio-economic progress and expand itsshare in the global economy, while \nsafeguardingthe environment for future generations.\nPrinciples\n\u2022\t Energy as an essential national service\n\u2022\t Sustainable and secure energy supply and consumption\n\u2022\t Energy economy as a source of foreign income\nACTIVITIES\n\u2022\t Electricity prices will be gradually loweredtoward the lowest in the region \nwithinfive years by implementing competitiveprocurement practices, prioritising \nsolarand wind energy projects with the goalof reducing dependence on oil-\nbasedgeneration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 189549, "end_char_idx": 194548, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e26c585-b4b5-4b5e-9257-a77f9daa1989": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e26c585-b4b5-4b5e-9257-a77f9daa1989", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7d08aa6-a7e6-49d4-9124-49c57b7075d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "a714e5e40d4b69d307a2f082440820b6514001b24894c36d393231bd0360b199", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3aac62a-0a70-40af-b717-7c00af407f47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"filename": "manifesto.pdf"}, "hash": "e445e53b48fd3f4436cc666173e2e5a15666c601a756585b62cb5c412e4b7131", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea1c594c-7257-46ad-adcc-fadbbe6aa526", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3f4fecf1a2e3faae2a02154b6c5591be404c06073c03b6f7d4c0d7762847c6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This policy includesstrategies to revive and enhance the ailingrefinery, national \nstorage and distributioninfrastructure for oil, ensuring an undisruptedenergy supply. \nWhile addressing these challenges,Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector will be transformedinto a \ncompetitive and transparent industry,equipped withmodern technology and focusedon \ncustomer empowerment.

Heavy traffic, wasting a lot of time on the road, transport services \nnot working at night, too many road accidents, and sexual and other harassment faced by \nwomen and children in public services characterises our passenger transport service. The \nreporting of around 30,000 road accidents a year is an indication of the lack of safety and \nits intensity in the transport sector. The contribution of the railway service has dropped to \n5% in the transport sector. The portion of the SLTB in bus passenger service has dropped \nto 14%. Around 55% of the citizens opt to use private vehicles to fulfil their transport \nneeds due to the decline in public transport, and they have to spend a large amount of \ntheir income on transport as a result. It has also resulted in high road traffic.\n88,200 km of the entire 119,382 km road network of Sri Lanka belongs to local government \ninstitutes, and many roads at the rural and semi-urban areas are in a dilapidated state due \nto lack of maintenance.

The region\u2019s \nshare of world GDP will reach 30.5%, and Asia will essentially be a middle-income region \nby 2025. Sri Lanka has a history of leadership in foreign policy, grounded in the principle \nof non-alignment. \nFor the mutual growth along with the other countries of the region as well as for the \nNational Security Foreign Policy play a crucial role. Factors that influence any State\u2019s \nforeign policy choices are geographical location, population, history, economic resources, \nideology, government efficiency, quality of diplomacy, crisis and immediate events, \ntechnological advancements, international law and institutions, etc. However, we have \nobserved in the recent past that the determinant of the foreign policy in Sri Lanka has \nmainly influenced by external factors and survival choices of ruling parties rather than \nthe best interest of Sri Lankans. National interests should be the cornerstone of the foreign \npolicy. Foreign policy reflects national interests and offers a perspective on human and \nglobal interests of a particular State. \nWhen the current situation of Sri Lanka is considered, we are passing a period of worst \neconomic crisis. One of the most important national interests of ours is to gradually \nwithdraw from the debt crisis.

A country\u2019s foreign policy \nis designed based on national strategy to protect and promote the national interests. \nForeign and domestic policies are intertwined more closely than ever before. Sri Lanka\u2019s \ncurrent foreign relations are influenced significantly by attempts to recover from the worst \neconomic crisis in 2022 and stands as a challenge we should overcome. Rising geopolitical \ntension among international and regional powers in our region has become a key challenge \nto Sri Lanka\u2019s security and regional stability. \nHowever, its geographical location as well as Sri Lanka\u2019s long invested diplomatic and \ncultural assets will become cornerstone our success. Comparatively higher human \n118\ndevelopment indicators such as the level of education and health, education of women, \netc.. than other south Asian countries have provided Sri Lanka a relatively positive cultural \nlevel of the population which will be a pro factor for achieving ambitious Economic and \nforeign policy targets also.\nSri Lanka has important diplomatic recognition earned through some wise and correct \nactions of the past. For instance, Sri Lanka has been a traditional friend of oppressed and \ncolonized nations in the world and Sri Lanka has always supported their independence. \nNumber of those countries are now not only independent but also has become major \nregional powers. Sri Lanka has been standing right side of the history promoting peace, \nsovereignty of the nations in various international issues. Sri Lanka has never supported \nany international war after its independence. Sri Lanka has a good name among many \nnations for its principled positions.

various religions such as Buddhist, Hindu, Islam, \nChristian, Catholic, etc. Because of that diversity, it is essential for the well-being and \nnational unity of the country to live in a multicultural society that exists by nature, \naccepting and respecting each other. But the country has failed to build the Sri Lankan \nnation by taking advantage of the various opportunities in history. The country had to face \na tragic war of 30 years as a result of creating mutual suspicion and mistrust and disunity \nbetween ethnicities and military groups for the sake of obtaining and maintaining power \nand narrow opportunistic political interests. The sorrows and sad results of that war still \nremain in Sri Lankan society. The National People\u2019s Power is dedicated to creating national \nunity for the building of the Sri Lankan nation, not divided based on ethnicity, language, \nreligion, caste, or gender, and by respecting the diversity of identities and ensuring their \nsurvival and protection.\n Principles\n\u2022\t Political partnership of all ethnicities \n\u2022\t No citizen/community should be subjected to humiliation, oppression, degrading \ntreatment or injustice on the basis of ethnicity, language, religion, caste, sex or \nany other grounds.\n\u2022\t Safety, mutual understanding, trust and rights of all ethnicities and religious \ngroups.\n\u2022\t A harmonious Sri Lankan nation undivided by racist, castes and religious \nideologies\nACTIVITIES\n\u2022\t Introduce a new constitution that strengthens democracy and ensures equality \nof all citizens.

\npeople can be involved in governance within one country.\n\u2022\t Provincial councils and local government elections, which are currently \npostponed indefinitely, will be held within a year to
