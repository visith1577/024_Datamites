# This is the manifesto of political candidate Ranil Wikramasinghe for Sri Lankan presidential election 2024

Everyone said it was impossible: but did it; believed it was possible:

At a time when the economy of the country had gone to rack and ruin with no hope for the future, no political party or leader came forward to take the challenge of rebuilding the country; they thought it was impossible.

But I accepted the challenge:

You know this story SO well; Do you remember those anarchic times? Those bygone days when we stayed in queues, holding empty gas cylinders. We took turns, remember? Mother in the morning; daughter in the evening, father at night and son in three-wheelers by petrol stations waiting for fuel? People lost lives in those queues. But was there anybody to complain? No, there was nobody to listen to your pains: So, when people could not take it anymore, they all took to the streets and screamed their frustrations out; They set fire to houses and killed politicians on the streets in broad daylight:

The Prime Minister resigned: The President stepped down. And all those politicians who now boast and inflate themselves declared that the country was beyond redemption and they fled into hiding:

I was just a UNP MP in the Parliament: Just one man: Eventually; they set fire to my house as well; The entire country was in flames. A country where people could be free and happy. A by-gone dream:

Nobody believed it was possible to build a peaceful and prosperous country again, But I rose from the ashes; I took the challenge because I have always loved my motherland; I always believed that this country could do better: It was my time to prove it.

So today; when I see people in my country smiling again, somehow having three meals a day; when I see vehicles back on the roads, and, Ramazan, and Christmas being celebrated, Sinhala and Tamil New Year; Thai Pongal, being initiated everywhere once again during Vesak, I feel a sincere pride: I have achieved the impossible!

The politicians who fled and hid during the crisis have now come out of their dens and are criticizing me; I found 10 billion rupees to hold the Presidential Elections in this country again: It is with much compassion I gaze at them:

We have restructured our debt and we are recovering rhythmically; Of course, I took over a bankrupt country: But we are gradually gaining speed: We have.

In 2019, when I left the post of Prime Minister; our Gross National Product (GNP) was USD 89 billion: But in 2022, when I took over the country as President, it was USD 76.9 billion: Our GNP had dropped by USD 12.1 billion!

However; by the end of 2023, we were able to increase it to USD 84.4 billion even amidst crisis! That is what I call possibility.

If we continue to tread this path, we can reach USD 89 billion by the end of 2025.
---
# This is the manifesto of political candidate Ranil Wikramasinghe for Sri Lankan presidential election 2024

Increases, and our purchasing power gets strengthened and our quality of life improves there onwards, it will only keep increasing: When the GNP increases; our income.

We have come so far on this precarious rope bridge, now we cannot turn back! We only have a few more steps to reach the end of the bridge: We can complete this arduous journey: Yes, we can!

Some say that things feel better now because we do not have to pay back the loans. It's not true: We did pay back the loans, approximately 2.5 billion rupees in 2022, and 2.6 billion rupees in 2023. The journey we have undertaken through hardships and obstacles has so far been a tremendous path of success: And I intend to complete this journey with you.

Do you want to take these crucial steps once and for all and enter a prosperous future, or do you want to get deceived by false promises and do experiments for change and fall back into a bottomless abyss? It's your decision; think before you decide.

One more thing: parties to pass relevant Acts in the Parliament and make plans which are critical for development: I did all this with just one seat in the Parliament; however, I garnered the support of many.

All of you, despite your political preferences, extended me your full support: That is why I am contesting this Presidential Election as an independent candidate.

My service is not only for you who are from the previous and the new generations but also for those children who are yet to be born. I stand for all of you who have varied political views. I am here for your future. For our motherland; Yes; I am here for you, and I will do my best for my country in the next five years: I will rebuild this country.

The next five years will be a triumphant time for Sri Lanka: When our country celebrates 100 years of independence in 2048, it will be a developed nation on the world map: rebuilding the nation that hit rock bottom in 2022, and laying a strong foundation for its recovery and revitalization: I believe we can do it; I may not live so long: But what now is.

Come, let's rebuild our motherland; Yes; we can!

Yours sincerely,

# The Most Mature Candidate

who changed the entire country within just two years
---
# This is the manifesto of political candidate Ranil Wikramasinghe for Sri Lankan presidential election 2024

A nation can only be built and transformed through visionary thinking and action, not merely by words. He has proven it within the past two years.

People who were stuck in fuel queues then are now laughing in dansal queues; Pause for a moment and compare the present situation with the state of the country two years back;

He accepted the enormous challenge of crossing over an arduous rope bridge of economic uncertainty: He finished what he started, he completed what he took responsibility for:

He worked according to a plan: He had a far-sighted vision.

During the past two years, he introduced new Acts unlike any other President: New laws were passed covering the areas that were never touched.

Within the aim of directing the country in the right direction, he has created approximately one hundred (yes; 100!) laws in the Parliament so far:

- The Anti-corruption Act;
- The Central Bank Act;
- The Election Expenditure Regulations;
- The Public Debt Management Act;
- The Truth and Reconciliation Act;
- The Online Safety Act;
- The Public Debt Act;
- The Electricity Act;
- The Women Empowerment Act;
- The Public Finance Management Act;
- The Economic Transformation Act, are some of the crucial Acts introduced by him:

The main candidates contesting this Presidential Election have held various ministerial positions under different governments. Some have even been Leader of the Opposition and the Chief Opposition Whip:

Among them, Ranil remains a gleaming beacon who has placed his seal in the history of Sri Lanka. It was during his time as the Minister of Youth, that this Ministry of Youth saw its golden years: When he was the Minister of Education, the Ministry was at its peak: The country saw growth in all its industries across the island when he was the Minister of Industries: The economy of the country took a new turn during his time as the Prime Minister and the Minister of Economic Policies;

Which other presidential candidate has such an illustrious past?

Yes, he held the post of Prime Minister several times, but there was always a President above him: Two years ago, when he became the President for the first time; he was able to perform his duties towards the country independently and drive us towards development:

He recovered the nation from a state of misery within just two years - an unbelievable achievement;

He is the only person who has proven himself with action, not mere empty words.

Many people criticize his journey in public but sing his praises in private.

If you are still not certain about your vote in this crucial Presidential Election, read the following quotes and make your decision; These are not the claims made by ordinary people, but by international scholars who are experts in the fields of economy; social sciences and political sciences:

# The Theravada Trade Economy

The term 'Theravada Trade Economy' may sound unfamiliar to you: We have learned that in the past, different countries followed different economic systems. Some economic systems were successful while some failed: We intend to develop our economy by generating income through several sectors under the Theravada Trade Economic System:
---
# Sri Lanka

The concept of Theravada was practiced during the Kingdom of Rajarata in ancient Sri Lanka; an economic system based on the

Under this economic system, we exercised trade with countries from China to Persia. Sri Lanka was considered the economic center of the Indian Ocean; and was a key hub of the ancient Silk Road.

Our country was equipped with the mechanism, facilities and the capability to distribute to the entire Eastern part of the world, which is why Sri Lanka was called the 'Granary of the East.'

In the 13th Century, Thailand captured its trade: These two kingdoms dominated the regional market for 18 centuries. But in recent years, Sri Lanka and Thailand have strived to regain economic strength.

In the late 1980s, Thailand transformed itself into a market economy based on exports and tourism; Sri Lanka was limited to domestic production and shifted to an import substitute economy.

# Gross Domestic Product per Capita

|Year|Sri Lanka|Thailand|
|---|---|---|
|1960|USD 144|USD 104|
|2023|USD 3,828|USD 7,172|
---
# Sri Lanka

Our economic policies have been primarily focused on domestic production: The deficit is imported since the domestic products are not sufficient for daily needs; The budget deficit is settled by local and foreign debts.

The Lord Buddha has shown in the Samannaphala Sutta that loans should be taken not for consumption but for investment: We have ignored such an important economic concept; By 2022 there was a burden of about USD 84 billion over our shoulders, but most of those loans have been utilized for consumption: As a result, we lost our image and reputation before the world, two years ago. The country completely collapsed.

By the year 2022, the economy of the country had undergone a severe contraction. The GDP dropped; The foreign sector of the economy collapsed. And then, the rupee started depreciating: The value of the dollar, which was 183.61 rupees in 2019, rose up to 363.11 rupees by 2022. Inflation, which was 3.53% in 2019, increased up to 70% in 2022.

As a result of the decreasing rate of development; the rate of decline of the economy accelerated. The only way to lessen the cost of living is to hit breaks on the country's decline and work towards an acceleration in the development of the economy:

# Sri Lanka

# We Started Afresh

Initiating a tough mission of recovery, we started negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The situation of the economy was serious during the initial discussions, and this weak position of the country posed a disadvantage to our standpoint during the discussions. But we did not give up, for our aim was to transform the country back to normal; our expectation was to build a country which never sees queues for essential needs again.

And today, the world has accepted that the Theravada trade economy followed by us is a resounding success.

# Reduced Cost of Living

We strive to lighten your burdens in life by reducing the cost of living; it will be part of our bigger plan of strengthening the economy. We will not borrow more and more foreign loans, as a strategy to gain popularity, for such reliefs are temporary.

Because of the plan we followed, inflation which was 70% in 2022 dropped to 2.81% by July 2024. The buying rate of USD which was initially Rs. 400 has now dropped below 300 rupees. In 2022, one litre of 92 Petrol was Rs. 470, but today it is Rs. 344. One litre of Auto diesel was Rs. 460 back then; but today it is Rs. 317. The electricity bills and water bills are gradually decreasing.

As a result, the cost of living is reducing day by day. Sri Lanka is gradually returning to normalcy.

More measures will be taken to further lighten the burden of living by providing essential items at more concessional rates in future.

Yes, we can!

# Tax Relief

The fiscal reforms that were implemented since 2015 were suddenly suspended in 2019 by the then government: Taxes were reduced unreasonably: Government revenue dropped to the lowest level in the world: It is one of the main reasons for the country to fall into an economic disaster;

We sought the assistance of the IMF to save our country: We stood before them as a bankrupt nation that had broken their agreement 16 times. Hence, we had no power for negotiations. Accepting their policies on government revenue was the best option to save the country at that moment;

That is why we had to impose taxes. We did not do it willingly: We were out of options at that time. Doctors, engineers, and university academics had to suffer due to the taxes imposed.

However; now that the economy of the country has gained momentum and we have reached some stability, we received consensus from the IMF to revisit the tax conditions. Accordingly; it has been proposed to increase the gap between the present tax slabs and to amend tax percentages;

Very soon, we can take a final decision in this regard:

We will be taking steps to pay tax-free service incentives to professionals in the future: Many people are suffering due to indirect taxes; we will take measures to systematically abolish indirect taxes.

These two tasks will be executed within the next two years and tax relief will be provided to taxpayers, very soon;

And today; the world has accepted that the Theravada trade economy followed by us is a resounding success.

# Let's Look at Thailand and Vietnam

Vietnam, a Mahayana Buddhist nation, stands as a fine example. In 1990, Vietnam followed our economic policy, but in 1995, it adopted the economic policy of Thailand: The results of the economic development of Vietnam speak for themselves.

# Gross Domestic Product

|Year|Sri Lanka|Vietnam|
|---|---|---|
|1990|USD 8 billion|USD 6.5 billion|
|2023|USD 84.4 billion|USD 429 billion|

Thailand and Vietnam have successfully crossed the rope bridge: We have also started to follow the Theravada market economy; but it will only be successful if we meet the following targets:

# Targets

|Indicator|Present Condition|Target|Time Frame|
|---|---|---|---|
|Budget Surplus|GDP 0.6% (2023)|GDP 2.3%|2025-2032|
|Public Debt|GDP 111% (2023)|GDP 95%|2032|
|Gross Financial Needs|GDP 27.8% (2023)|GDP 13%|Approximately 2027|
|Foreign Debt Services|GDP 9.2% (2022)|GDP 4.5%|2027-2032 Annual Limit|
|Gross Foreign Reserves|USD billion 5.6 (July 2024)|USD Billion 15.1|2028|
|Inflation|2.4% (July 2024)|5%|Continuously|
|Treasury Bonds|GDP 7% (2023)|less than 7.5%|Continuously|

# Manifesto of Political Candidate Ranil Wikramasinghe for Sri Lankan Presidential Election 2024

# Economic Plan

We will adhere to the following plan:

- No permission will be given to withhold arrears of government payments for more than three months.
- Printing of money by the Central Bank to settle the budget deficit will be strictly prohibited.
- The price for electricity and fuel should be decided based on the cost borne.
- If the Electricity Board and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation incur losses, the Treasury should immediately and directly provide funds for the same.
- The amount spent on social security should not be reduced beyond the amount prescribed.

These targets and limits are fixed and we will not compromise or negotiate them under any circumstance.

Our official creditors and China have granted us the concessions, subject to the above targets and limits.

If we cannot achieve those targets and limits, we will lose not only the assistance of the IMF, but also all the debt concessions. In which case that happens, we will fall back to the bottomless abyss and will be beyond redemption.

Therefore, what we should do is stabilize our economy and gain a higher economic growth rate within these limits and targets.

During the election period, many political parties will hide this truth and give you various false promises, but none of those promises are practical, but mere lies to win votes. This is why none of those parties or candidates have come forward for an open discussion with the IMF.

# Towards a Thriving Nation

We are aiming at creating an export-oriented manufacturing and service economy: If the economy is not strengthened, any other sector of the country cannot be developed: A hungry nation has no room for spiritual development: Lord Buddha has also pointed out that it is useless to preach to a hungry person;

If we do not proceed with this plan; we will face an even worse economic crisis in a few years. It can only be prevented by moving forward on the path we have followed so far.

We cannot be indebted to the world forever. A debt economy cannot uplift a nation: But, if we continue along this path, we will be able to build a debt-free, developed economy by 2048.

# A Generation Free of Poverty

Around 25% of the community is facing various hardships due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent economic crisis. Be it the unavailability of opportunities, lack of facilities to get a decent education, denied access to clean water and electricity, unemployment, or denied rights to get married and raise children, all these issues have to be addressed:

We pledge to prioritize providing solutions to these problems; We will work hard to reduce the proportion of low-income people suffering from diverse hazards to 10%, during the next 5 years. We have formulated the National Social Protection Policy which would lay a foundation for solving this issue.

With the intention of redeeming people from poverty; we launched Aswesuma, which is a massive and more extensive programme than Samurdhi. Under this programme, we are providing financial assistance to 2.4 million families: Families facing economic difficulties are receiving a maximum of Rs 15,000 and the senior citizens, individuals with special needs and kidney patients in these families are receiving financial assistance separately: This amount is higher than the Samurdhi allowance: Aswesuma and Samurdhi programmes will be integrated and utilized for this purpose systematically:

We have identified the communities that are suffering from extreme poverty and social oppression: These families will be made regular participants in divisional development programmes and priority will be given to such communities when recruiting employees for government projects related to local infrastructure development; thereby empowering them economically;

Areas with such community groups will be further identified and special attention will be given to those areas in complying with the overall programme to eradicate poverty:

# Towards a Beautiful 2048

The Theravada Trade Economy will ensure an adequate standard of living for all the citizens; We will be able to create highly competitive, export-oriented digital green economy through this journey; and we will be able to achieve all our economic goals by 2048. We have already passed and implemented the primary laws aiming for necessary transformation towards such a development stage.

Particularly; the Central Bank Act; the Public Finance Management Act; the Public Debt Management Act and the Economic Transformation Act hold a significant importance in this matter and through these enactments, the following will be achieved;

- New employment opportunities will be created, and thereby the job market will be expanded.
- New income generation opportunities will be created.
- The income generation will be increased.

Most of the countries worldwide have achieved development by resting a larger fraction of the economy on the private sector; We plan to establish the Theravada Trade Economy on a wider dimension;

We will add two sectors to our economy to compete with a robust private sector.

# Sri Lanka

# The Government Sector

The Government has the power to regulate the entire economic system. Government-owned banks, financial institutions and enterprises conduct this financial management on a competitive basis.

# II. Peoples' Sector

Article 27(2)(e) of the Constitution is the basis for the new concept of the Peoples' Sector; "the establishment of a just social order in which the means of production, distribution and exchange are not concentrated and centralised in the State, State agencies or in the hands of a privileged few; but are dispersed among and owned by, all the People of Sri Lanka."

In order to make the Peoples' Sector a solid stakeholder in the economy:

- Opportunities will be given to every citizen to be entitled to a land or a house.
- National Wealth Fund will be established.
- The cooperative movement will be completely restructured.

# Property Rights

A separate authority will be established to ensure systematic and expeditious delivery of rights to citizens: This will ensure land ownership to 2 million people through the Urumaya programme and the transfer of low-income housing owned by the government in the Colombo city to the residents within 4 years.

Loans will be granted at concessional rates to middle-class families for the construction of houses: Low-income families shall be given the opportunity to own their houses in condominiums.

New villages will be established for the plantation workers and those living in line rooms will be granted the right to own a plot of land.

Several housing schemes will be launched under local and foreign investments within the next two years with the government intervention and we will encourage the local and foreign investors to construct apartments comprising of numerous floors covering all the major cities in the country.

The above measure will pave the way to reviving the construction industry which has been halted at present; within the next two years.

# Sri Lanka

# Financial Rights

Significant Trade Union representation will be allowed in the Board membership of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees' Trust Fund (ETF). Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce will also be included to ensure better financial administration.

These funds are currently utilized for government purposes. Whenever the government faces a shortage of finance, these funds are utilized for treasury bonds. We aim to change this practice: When the economy of the country is stable, the utilization of these funds for government purposes will eventually cease.

This would allow the investment of these funds in safe local and international financial institutions which would bring a high income to the country. By 2023, the Employees' Provident Fund and the Employees' Trust Fund will become the largest investment fund in the country. This would bring more benefits to the members of the fund.

# National Wealth Fund

The National Wealth Fund will be formed by combining the budget surplus and the profits of government institutions. This fund will be invested in local and international stock markets.

# Cooperatives

The cooperative movement will be completely reorganized in accordance with international standards. New rules will be introduced to make the cooperative movement independent so that changes in political and government systems will not intervene in the management of this sector. A series of new cooperative laws will be adopted in compliance with the cooperative model functioned in Scandinavian countries. The cooperative movement will thus be raised to a higher level to make it capable of facing the current market competition.
---
# Operation Beyond 2025

This operation is 100% practical. It has been designed based on the future growth rate of development of the country; scientific estimates about the future income generated, and the resources that could be utilized: That is why this plan includes specific time frames as well:
---
# Climate Change

There are a number of climate change challenges we will have to face in future as a tropical country such as the increase of global warming, changes in rainfall, and sea level rise. We will build disaster-resilient cities in the districts that are prone to natural disasters;

We foresaw these issues and took measures within the last two years, paving the way for green economy: Thus, we have been taking action to lay a foundation to convert the disadvantages of global climate change into advantages for our country:

We have been given a foremost place in the World Climate Change Programme due to our commitment to addressing climate change: We have launched a number initiatives in this regard such as the Climate Justice Forum, the Climate Prosperity Plan and the International Climate Change University:

We are a principal stakeholder of the Global Financing Pact entered into by the countries of the Global North and the Global South under the patronage of France, in order to address the global climate changes. We have also joined the Global Blended Financial Alliance initiated by Indonesia focusing on the countries in the Global South.

We have launched a Tropical Region Collaboration programme at present with the aim of ensuring environmental safety in the tropical region.

Active participation in these initiatives provides us with opportunities to strengthen our economy: Creating an apt background for the said purpose, we are also determined to enforce the Climate Change Act:

We will be taking action to establish a Climate Change Secretariat and a Climate Change Fund, which will help us face climate challenges successfully while protecting our environment;

Sri Lanka has been blessed with a wealth of biodiversity: We wish to enact a new Biodiversity Law and establish a Regulatory Body to conserve the biodiversity of the country:

Since climate change is impacting all aspects of development; environmental-friendly procedures with focus on climate change, will be introduced for sectors such as agriculture, industries, energy, etc, as specified in this five-year action plan:

These tasks have already been initiated, The progress will be evident in future;

# A Modern Agro-Culture

The current world population is around 8 billion: By 2050, this will increase by 29% totalling up to 9.8 billion: Agricultural production therefore should be increased to cater to this rising population in future.

Our target should be to supply at least a miniscule percentage of that requirement: In this context; we will introduce highly competitive export-oriented, high-income generating, modern agro-culture: We will encourage organic cultivation targeting large foreign markets.

Farmers will be provided with seeds, fertilizer and modern machinery required for modern agricultural methods. A supply chain where agro-products will be directly purchased from the farmers will be created: The establishment of a chain of storages across the island in order to uplift the rural agriculture industry; is also in the works.

Home garden cultivations and subsistence crop cultivations in urban apartments will be highly encouraged; Three hundred thousand (300,000) acres of land will be allocated out of the underutilized State Land for export-oriented commercial crop cultivation.

Proper instructions and assistance will be provided to Urumaya freehold deed recipient farmers to expand and improve their cultivations. We will encourage them to use those lands for productive crop cultivation and activities related to other agro-enterprises.

We have drawn up plans to modernize crop transport and sales, while minimizing waste during storage: A well-organized programme to popularize the local foods in collaboration with the Government will be launched.

The completion of Malwathu Oya, Thalpitigala and Vayamba Ela projects will be expedited in order to fulfill the water requirement for agricultural purposes and daily chores; The first phase of these projects is expected to be completed by 2030.

An amount of Rs. 25,000 will be directly credited to the accounts of farmers for the purchase of fertilizer and other requirements needed for paddy cultivation. A fixed rate will be declared for the selling price of paddy from season to season.

# A Sustainable Ocean Economy

Although our island home is surrounded by the ocean, even less than 40% of the boats we own at present are utilized for fishing. It is planned to implement a plan to reap maximum benefits from the ocean with the patronage of the local and foreign experts. This is expected to double the income of USD 300 million we currently earn via fisheries products exportation.

The freshwater fishery industry, prawn cultivation, aquatic plants, and ornamental fish industry are expected to be promoted and expanded. The fishery harbours across the island will be developed and upgraded to Fishery Economic Centres. Fishing societies, fishermen, investors and experts will be linked to these centers in order to yield the best out of the economic centres.

We will be launching a concessionary scheme for the purchase of vessels from small fishing vessels to multi-day fishing trawlers. Foreign investments for the development of the fishery industry will be encouraged. Steps will be taken to modernize the fishery industry to be in par with the international trends. The fishing community will be given the required assistance regarding the use of modern vessels, equipment and technology.

In this manner, within a period of a few years, we will be able to uplift the living standards of the fishing community. Fishing towns around fishing harbours are expected to be developed and fishermen will be equipped with proper housing and other community facilities. Steps have already been taken to credit the fuel allowance provided to fishermen directly to their bank accounts.

These initiatives will be implemented within the year 2025. Since we are an island, we are surrounded by a rich seabed, which we have not yet utilized to get maximum benefits. A long-term action plan to reap the maximum benefits of the resources in the seabed will be implemented with the aid of international expertise. The first phase of all these plans will be launched from 2025 to 2029.

# Strengthening the Dairy Sector

Only an amount of 35% of the dairy requirement is manufactured within the country. Due to the low dairy harvest, Milko Ltd operates many of its modern machinery only during a short period of the year. As a result of this, USD 282 million flows to other countries for milk importation per year.

While 35 litres of milk is extracted from each cow in the Ambewela Private Farm daily, only about 5 litres are extracted from a cow in other dairy farms in the country.

A programme to raise the dairy harvest by connecting the National Livestock Development Board with Indian authorities related to the dairy industry is already in progress. This would positively impact the local dairy industry in the aspects of technology and investment.

# Through this programme, the following will be achieved:

- Increase the current annual dairy production from 380 million litres to 820 million litres by the year 2035.
- Provide a glass of fresh milk for all school children in the country free of charge.
- Be self-sufficient with dairy production and be able to save the money that flows out of the country to import milk and create income-generating opportunities with the byproducts manufactured using the excess.
- Provide facilities such as high genetic animals, animal food, medicine, and cattle semen for artificial insemination for over 200,000 small dairy farmers and entrepreneurs.
- Provide 20,000 high-genetic cattle within the year 2025 for the local dairy farmers.
- Increase the income currently generated by local dairy farmers up to an amount more than 40 billion rupees by 2035 and thereby strengthen the rural economy.
- Launch a concessionary loan scheme for local dairy farmers.
- Increase the dairy harvest yielded by the local dairy farmers from one cow per day up to 20 litres.

The first phase of this programme will be launched in 2025 and the tasks will be completed by 2035.

# Visit Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is a top tourist destination in the world. The infrastructure required to provide a better experience for the tourists will be upgraded and the tourist arrivals which is 2.5 million will be increased to million within the forthcoming five years. The gross income received to the country from one tourist is currently USD 150, and it will be increased up to USD 500 by the year 2035.

The cities Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Trincomalee will be developed as the main tourist hubs. We will also provide necessary facilities to convert the Eastern coast and Jaffna to high-end tourist destinations. Steps will be taken to further increase the demand for the Southern coastal area. The tourist industry will be expanded to the hill country with better activities and attractions for tourists.

The sacred city of Anuradhapura will be transformed into an iconic city of cultural heritage, and it is expected to be as popular as the Sigiriya.

# Tourist Zones Development

|Location|Area (acres)|
|---|---|
|Iranawila|400|
|Bentota|1000|
|Haputale-Welimada|100|

Public-Private Partnerships for various aspects of the tourism industry will be encouraged, which would include the refurbishment of hotels/rest houses and the construction of new hotels. These tasks will be commenced in the year 2025 and completed by 2033.

# Taking our Products to the World

If we need to take the next leap in the economy; we will have to uplift our industries and improve our products to a level where they can compete in the international market: We already have gained international acclamation for apparel, tyres for industrial vehicles, etc. and it is high time we utilized the recognition. It is expected to import modern machinery made with modern technology to improve the aforementioned productions. International investments, technology and expertise will thus be optimally utilized to overcome the current obstacles in order to nourish the production economy:

# Health, the Greatest Wealth

Sri Lanka has free health service. But, is health service truly free? The less fortunate have to be in the waiting list for years even to get an essential treatment such as cardiac surgeries. Our health service must be perceived at a new angle, and an atmosphere where optimal service is provided to the people, must be created.

A favourable environment will be built for doctors, nurses, other medical professionals and members of the supporting staff; to carry out their duties in a better manner. A key expectation of improving the condition of healthcare personnel is to reduce the brain drain.

Local and foreign training opportunities for the medical staff headed by the doctors will be expanded. Medical Officers will be provided more facilities to obtain postgraduate degrees.

In Sri Lanka, we have skilled and eminent Medical Officers serving all over the country. Our health service is also equipped with well-experienced supportive cadres. Therefore, we need to upgrade our health services to a higher standard to offer medical treatments to foreigners. On one hand, it will bring in foreign exchange and on the other; it will create background to upgrade the healthcare facilities offered to the general public through the money generated through medical tourism.

With this objective also in mind, we will rebuild the Colombo National Hospital as a modern hospital with international facilities. It is expected to be converted into one of the key hospitals in South Asia.

The conditions of government hospitals located across the country are to be upgraded. Government hospitals will be constructed in proportion to the population ratio and the healthcare services will be upgraded to an optimal level within the next 15 years.

The Medical Research Institute will be strengthened with modern technology with the intention of making it the supreme research laboratory in the region.

With the objective of ensuring the availability of high quality medicine, steps will be taken to establish a Pharmaceutical Standardization Institute recognized by the international standardization institutes.

Proper measures will be taken to minimize waste through smart healthcare service using Artificial Intelligence, digitalization and automation.

Traditional and indigenous medicine will be promoted and preserved. We will introduce a system to gift the invaluable knowledge of traditional and indigenous medicine to the future generation.

New laws will be introduced to subject private hospitals to proper regulation. The establishment of private hospitals in all nine provinces shall be encouraged.

Special attention will be provided to introduce a resilient health care insurance scheme enabling all citizens to receive treatments from any hospital of their preference.

# Culture and Arts

We will commence a pop music and dancing academy for the youth who love the popular culture.

We will set up a fully equipped theatre in every district and organize annual events with the cultural centres that are currently functioning.

All the government-owned theaters in Colombo including the Tower Hall and Elphinstone Theatre will be established under one umbrella institute and developed to utilize them in a better manner.

# Film Development

The National Film Corporation will be established as Film Development Commission to keep up with the current international trends and will be renamed "Film Sri Lanka". It will be a gateway to raise our cinema industry up to international level on digital platforms. The relevant Bill that gives the authority to implement a number of tasks focusing on the development of cinema is now at its final stage of drafting. After the approval, the government will not intervene with any of the businesses in the field of cinema since it will be established as an independent entity. Only regulation would be done by the government. This Bill will be presented to the Parliament in 2025.

# Public Performance Classification

The draft Bill for establishing the Public Performance Classification Board cancelling the present Censor Board is now completed. No accusation shall thus be made against a work of art under criminal law if the work holds a classification certificate. The draft bill will be passed in the Parliament in 2025.

# A Better Environment for Media

Both multi-community media and modern media are needed to create a sensitive society. We will be drafting a national journalism policy and building a strong foundation to create a society that values humanity, discipline, loyalty, and integrity.

We will empower and strengthen journalists and freelance writers. A higher education institute on journalism will be established in 2025.

We will work towards solving the issues faced by the regional journalists. An Electronic Media Regulatory Commission will be established to generate a transparent media environment which holds values.

# Manifesto of Ranil Wikramasinghe for Sri Lankan Presidential Election 2024

# One Nation

Sri Lanka is home to people from different ethnicities, all of whom are citizens of the country and thus have the right to live decent lives. We will ensure happy and free living for all in unified Sri Lanka.

Two years ago, the economic crisis shattered the people's hopes in all aspects. People lost the hope of moving forward. But now, the time has come for everyone to be united and come together to create a beautiful future for the country. The future which we will be creating will benefit all citizens equally, irrespective of ethnicity.

No citizen who speaks in Tamil should be neglected by the Sinhala community, and similarly, no citizen who speaks in Sinhala should be neglected by the Tamil and Muslim ethnicities. We will make sure that an atmosphere where people from different religions could live harmoniously like relatives and friends will be created.

We will give prominence to reconciliation and creating prosperous lives for all citizens. Viable solutions will be provided for the social, economic, political, cultural, and educational issues of the Northern and Eastern provinces.

The lands people have lost during the time of war is a complex issue. A National Land Commission will be established to provide viable solutions for these land issues.

Tamil and Muslim communities in the Northern and Eastern provinces who have started lives anew after the war are facing a number of issues. The following action will be taken to address their issues:

- Enacting the Truth and Reconciliation Act
- Implementing the Nawaz Commission Report on missing persons
- Provide financial assistance to the rehabilitated LTTE members to engage in self-employment

# A Great Power

A single government will not be able to accomplish all these work over the next five years on its own: Therefore, both the central government and the local government system need to collaboratively share the responsibility:

Based on the proposals we have made about implementing the 13th Amendment to the Constitution;

We will devolve power to the Provincial Councils as per the Constitution: The powers of the Provincial Councils that come under Schedule 1, which are now vested under the Central Government will be devolved back to the Provincial Councils.

The decision of vesting police powers to Provincial Councils will be decided by the new Parliament.

The powers given under Schedule 3 that are approved by the party leaders will be given to the Provincial Councils:

# Provincial Councils will be given the power over the following areas:

- School education
- Vocational training
- Degree awarding institutions (with the ability to upgrade to university level later; if necessary)
- Provincial tourism promotion
- Agriculture modernization

Required laws will be passed regarding the above.

We will be taking measures to establish District Development Committees; Every community irrespective of the fact they are Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher; Indigenous or other; will have the right to act independently with a sense of justice as members of one nation despite different views: New laws will be formulated to devolve powers from the Central Government to Provincial Councils and Local Government Authorities;

It is expected to change the local government system in the year 2025. We will restructure the present Urban Councils and upgrade them to Municipal Councils. A system where power is executed through Pradeshiya Sabhas and Municipal Councils shall be introduced.

# Empowering the Citizen

Powerful citizens are assets to the country: But, currently; we have very few rules and regulations that empower citizens: Action will be taken to introduce new laws and agencies that are targeting empowering citizens.

# Social Justice Commission

We will establish the Social Justice Commission to prevent discrimination and marginalization of citizens, with the main aim of making people's voices heard.

# Peoples' Initiative Act

One of the main methods where people's sovereignty is exercised, is through voting, which takes place at the Presidential, Parliamentary and Provincial Council election levels: Peoples' Initiative Act will further enable citizens to submit proposals to the Parliament; In this manner; citizens could be directly involved in the law and policy-making process of the country: This Act will further strengthen democracy practised in the country.

# Jana Sabha

The aim of Jana Sabha is to have the active participation of provincial and rural communities in the decision-making process. Currently, several pilot projects are being implemented in this regard. We will establish Jana Sabhas with representatives from the 50,000 villages in the country dispersed throughout 14,002 Grama Niladhari Divisions.

# This is the manifesto of political candidate Ranil Wikramasinghe for Sri Lankan presidential election 2024

Ranil will win this election: There is absolutely no doubt:

Two years ago, we witnessed sadness everywhere: We saw people languishing in queues for essential needs. Homes were in darkness. There was no electricity: People couldn't even engage in their jobs. Everyone had economic difficulties.

But today; we see a country that smiles: A country illuminated with light and hope: A country where people can earn a living and live freely:

Who brought this change? Ranil Yes; Ranil:

Ranil is a leader who knows how to face challenges. He finishes what he starts. He does not give up mid-way. He has always been like that: He talks less, and he acts with precision:

It was twenty-three years ago when he envisioned giving freehold deeds to people and did the groundwork: He strove to make it a reality all these years. The Presidents before him never permitted the proposal; but Ranil never gave up. Today; people not only have the rights of ownership to the lands but also the houses:

Therefore, it is crystal clear that it is only Ranil who can elevate our country to a higher standard: It is only him who can make our lives better: Ranil, and Ranil alone:

When other candidates fight over the Presidency; Ranil is far removed from the battle. For; he has no fight against individuals: His fight against poverty; unemployment and malnourishment;

He is not fighting for a position: He is in the midst of a struggle to make the lives of the youth better:

Ranil is fighting to bring victory to our motherland: His battle is to make Sri Lanka a developed nation; that is a pleasure to live in:

That is why Ranil will win this election: That is why Ranil will remain unbeatable:
