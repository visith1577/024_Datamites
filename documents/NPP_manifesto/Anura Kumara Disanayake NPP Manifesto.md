# Preface

The social transformation Sri Lanka needs today is not a mere change of government or filling of the spaces left by the departure of a ruling group. It is a massive social transformation beyond the reformation of just one or two sectors – in essence, a renaissance. It is the realization of the dream of a developed Sri Lanka that was stifled by corrupt regimes of the past. This is the dream of pioneering individuals produced by Sri Lanka in the post-independence period in various fields, such as engineering, health, education, art, literature, and human rights, who tried to lay solid foundations within those fields. Governance under the NPP will become a renaissance era because this dream that emerged in the twentieth century but was stifled and squandered can finally be realized in the twenty-first century.

Developing a production-based economy is our singular aim and guiding principle. For this reason, many of our policies are focused on areas such as mineral resources, information and software technology, tourism industry, agriculture, marine resources, and creative industries (e.g., art, cinema, literature, music, theatre, etc.) that can utilize resources found within the country, be easily developed, and can be mobilized by the professional and trained labour resources we already have. Science and technology will be the key players in our proposed production-based economy.

NPP regards education, health, and transportation as essential public services and plans to increase resource allocation in all these fields. We believe that education is a primary responsibility of the government, and therefore, we commit to reducing the burden of education placed on parents. Furthermore, efforts will be made to gradually eliminate the disparity in education across the country resulting from the inequality in the distribution of resources. Vocational education will be mainstreamed as part of the national education policy to fill the gap between education and the job market. We see vocational education as a significant factor in developing the professionals needed to create a production economy.

Our health policy focuses on increasing financial allocations to the public health sector to develop it as an effective public service. Further, we propose integrating the Western medical system with the Indigenous and Ayurvedic medical systems currently practised in the country and providing a high-quality and effective healthcare service to the public. Strengthening the state share in public transport and creating an efficient public transport system in the country, regardless of whether it is day or night, is a cornerstone in the multifaceted measures NPP plans to apply to the transport sector. We will move away from
---
## Environmental and Economic Vision

The NPP rejects anthropocentric thinking that places man as the sole owner of the earth, which conflicts with nature and aims to co-exist with all elements of the environment to maintain the balance of ecosystems. This foundation will support the realities of a systematic journey that is required for the economy to become a circular economy. We plan for the energy sector to be based on renewable energy sources, agriculture to become a practice that does not destroy ecosystems, and the construction industry to follow "green" practices.

## Women's Rights and Representation

"Gahenu Api Eka Mitata" is an exemplary women's movement that can be named as one of the biggest and most effective women's activist movements in Sri Lanka's history. The goal of the NPP is to create a society where women, who represent half of the country's population, enjoy equal rights, free from physical, verbal and emotional violence. Guided by this vision, our priority will be to uphold and introduce laws in alignment with international charters we have already signed and establish necessary protection mechanisms, leading to the transformation of attitudes and institutional changes. Our goal is to gradually increase the representation of women to 50% in all decision-making bodies, from Parliament to local government institutions.

## Cultural and Social Development

Another important vision of the NPP is to produce a cultured human being. Under our government, we believe in the transformational power of turning those who currently lack heart, care, and warmth—who live mechanical lives and do not consider others—into citizens who think of others, engage with art and philosophy, embrace humanity, and finally enjoy life. While the current regime leaves the entire burden of cost-of-living on people, we, the NPP, will absorb a substantial part of this responsibility into the government. Enhancing the quality of life and ease of living in a developed production economy will lay the foundation for creating a cultured society.

## Anti-Corruption Measures

An NPP government will be dedicated to eradicating the deeply entrenched corruption that has plagued our political culture over the past 76 years and will work towards establishing a more favourable and ethical political environment. Under our rule, reclaiming the wealth looted by corrupt elite ruling groups will begin, ultimately returning this wealth to the people. To achieve this, we will guide the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Police, and the Attorney General's Department by enacting necessary laws and ensuring they operate with full independence and authority.

## Justice and Accountability

Criminals will be held accountable as we will expose all information related to murders, including the Easter Sunday Attacks and the murders of journalists, sports figures, and targeted groups, which have been left unresolved. Additionally, we are committed to eradicating fraud and corruption at all levels—from kickbacks and commissions to bribery—whether in massive development projects or something as basic as enrolling a child to school.

## Governance Reform

For the first time in Sri Lanka's post-independence history, governance will shift from the control of a few corrupt elite families to a people's government. From the presidency to every representative body and operational mechanism in the country, all positions will be free from elite family connections and will be filled by the children of ordinary citizens produced through free education. An NPP government will usher in a new era of citizen activism, collective intervention, social justice, and the application of good governance principles. The elitist relationship between rulers and the people that has existed since independence will be replaced by a new social contract—one of proud citizens and leaders who are friends of the people they serve. A fundamental step towards this goal is introducing a governmental structure where citizens can conduct their affairs without relying on politicians. The NPP rejects the notion of a Prince Diyasen, King, or Hero who
---
## Governance and Development

The NPP views governance and development as a collective effort, rejecting the notion that any single individual can save the country alone. In this new system:

- Less qualified political henchmen will be replaced by competent individuals appointed through a specific merit-based process.
- Institutions will be allowed to function without political interference.
- The independence of the judiciary will be fully guaranteed.
- Protection and welfare mechanisms will be introduced to safeguard various groups who may be susceptible to unfair treatment.

## Global Integration and National Development

The NPP believes that Sri Lanka's underdevelopment and backwardness stem in large part from being isolated from the global community. To address this, we will:

- Actively promote fields such as science and technology, research, education, culture, art, cinema, music, philosophy, and sports at the state, corporate, and individual levels.

## Building a Unified Sri Lankan Nation

A key initiative of the NPP will be the effort to build a unified Sri Lankan nation. The NPP acknowledges that:

- The elite ruling class, which has governed the country until now, failed to unite the Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and plantation communities under one flag as a Sri Lankan nation.
- Instead, they exacerbated conflicts between these groups to maintain their power.

Our approach includes:

- Implementing a range of material, structural, and operational interventions to address this issue.
- Creating space for all ethnicities to envision a shared future as a unified Sri Lankan nation.
- Involving all communities in the process—from designing a production economy to ensuring fair distribution of its benefits.

## Call to Action

We invite all Sri Lankans who aspire to A Thriving Nation and a Beautiful Life to actively join the NPP in building a people's government and collectively implementing our proposed policy program.

The image shows a striking black and white photograph taken looking upwards through a forest canopy. The trees' branches and leaves create an intricate pattern against a bright sky, forming a natural dome-like structure. 

The contrast between the dark tree trunks and branches and the bright foliage and sky creates a mesmerizing, almost lace-like effect. The trees appear to be tall and slender, reaching towards the sky, with their uppermost branches intertwining.

This perspective, known as a "worm's-eye view," emphasizes the height and majesty of the forest. The monochromatic nature of the image adds to its dramatic and artistic quality, highlighting the textures and patterns formed by the trees and leaves.

The overall effect is one of awe-inspiring natural beauty, showcasing the complexity and interconnectedness of a forest ecosystem. It invites the viewer to pause and appreciate the intricate details and grand scale of nature.

# 01. A FULFILLING LIFE A COMFORTABLE COUNTRY

## 1.1 A civilized citizen- an advanced human resource

### Introduction

Education is a cultural process that generates new knowledge by acquiring and disseminating existing knowledge. The existence and development of a civilized and responsible society hinge on the quality of its education. In Sri Lanka, the education system faces several crises. A major issue is the high dropout rate, with many students leaving school before completing at least 13 years of education. For example, in 2008, 11.3% of children who entered the first year left school before sitting for the GCE O/L examination in 2018. By 2020, only 64.7% of students who sat for the GCE O/L examination proceeded to the GCE A/L level, meaning that 35.3% of those who entered the first year did not reach the GCE A/L examination. Only 35.4% of these students passed the GCE A/L examination and merely 12.7% secured university entrance.

Another significant problem is the disparity in the distribution of human and physical resources within the school system, which has led to a breakdown in parental trust in the system. According to the 2022 school census report, out of 10,126 schools, 1,473 (14.5%) have fewer than 50 students, and 5,204 schools (51.4%) have fewer than 200 students. This means that over half of the schools are underutilized and lack basic facilities. Only 396 schools are classified as national schools, and just 2,959 schools (29%) offer GCE A/L subject streams. The high cost of education that has to be borne by parents, despite the policy of free education from the first year to the first degree, is another major concern.

Furthermore, serious social criticism exists on the education system's failure to produce quality citizens. While education is not solely about preparing individuals for the job market, it should equip citizens to fulfil social responsibilities and contribute positively to the national economy. The current mismatch between the education system and the needs of the main economic sectors, agriculture, industry, and service, is evident.

The NPP's education policy aims to provide quality education that fosters a developed, humanistic, and responsible society. To achieve these goals, we will increase public investment in the education sector, gradually raising the allocation to education as a percentage of the gross domestic product up to 6%.

## 1.2 A vigorous life - Healthy people

### Introduction

According to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, health is a human right. The right to health is intrinsically linked to all other human rights. Patient empowerment is one of the key elements of patient-centred healthcare. Gender inequality remains a critical challenge in the health sector. Achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is one of the world's nations' targets when adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). All Sri Lankans have access to the full range of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. Therefore, it is the duty of the responsible government to provide the most efficient evidence-based medical care to all citizens without delay. Quality healthcare systems include patient safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and patient-centeredness. Safety and quality systems are integrated with governance processes to enable the Ministry of Health to actively manage and improve the safety and quality of health care for patients.

The WHO's ranking of the world's health systems indicated that the Sri Lankan health system was 76 in the year 2000. According to the 2024 edition of the CEOWORLD magazine's Health Care Index, Sri Lanka has been ranked as 105 globally. The WHO recommends that government expenditure on health as a % of GDP should be, at least 5%. Further, a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their expenditure on health care out of pocket now. WHO further recommends that out-of-pocket expenditure on health should be less than 20%. But a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their expenditure on health care out of pocket now. The reforms will require strengthening all aspects of the health system – financing, human resources, pharmaceuticals, and information systems – to meet the needs of a complex service delivery system.

### Principles

- The right of individuals to receive the benefits of the health care system with respect and dignity.
- The state's responsibility to provide disease prevention and treatment health services to citizens without discrimination.
- Promotion of health, disease prevention, and preventive health care.
- Health services that meet global standards.
- Protection of patients' rights and safety.

# 1.3 A comfortable home - A healthy living

## Introduction

The housing issue in Sri Lanka, particularly in urban areas, has become increasingly severe, especially for low-income families. In Colombo alone, approximately 65,000 homes in low-income settlements are spread across 1,000 acres. Residents in these areas have been largely neglected by previous governments and suffer from a lack of basic amenities such as water, electricity, sanitation, and clean air. While other urban residents can build, buy, or rent homes, varying income levels make these options challenging for many. Government employees, in particular, struggle with the high cost of rent, as their incomes are often insufficient to cover these expenses.

Rural housing issues also persist, although they have received less attention from the government. Even when families own land, they face problems such as unclear land ownership, poor locations, lack of access roads, high costs of building materials, and unstable income levels, making it difficult to construct or maintain homes. Approximately 2% of Sri Lanka's rural population lives in estate housing, primarily in the Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern Provinces. Most of these estate worker communities reside in overcrowded line houses with minimal facilities. Significant social issues arise as the number of households within these communities increases. Despite having land, the low incomes of these families prevent them from building adequate homes, forcing them to live under extremely poor conditions.

Our goal is to construct multi-story housing complexes wherever possible, efficiently managing the limited land available and addressing the needs of the people.

## Principles

- A healthy home for every individual
- Effective land management
- Comprehensive housing projects

## ACTIVITIES

- Offering financial support to newly married couples for purchasing or constructing their homes.

## Urban Housing

- Encouraging the private sector to develop affordable housing projects in urban areas and providing appropriate land for these initiatives.
- Promoting investments from Sri Lankans living abroad in affordable housing projects in urban areas.
- Implementing programs to provide official residences for government employees close to their workplaces.
---
• Facilitating the provision of affordable housing for residents of low-income settlements in Colombo through government intervention.

• Developing comprehensive housing projects in urban and semi-urban areas, including essential facilities such as healthcare, education, sports, transportation, and parks.

## Rural Housing

• Enhancing access roads to residential areas.

• Establishing housing loan schemes to support home constructions.

## Estate Housing

• Providing financial and infrastructural support to enhance housing, water and sanitation facilities for Malayagam communities.

• Allocating lands for Malayagam communities to construct permanent homes.

• Developing affordable housing schemes in areas surrounding estates.

## 1.4 An Energetic Citizen - Triumphant People

### Introduction

Sports play a crucial role not only in fostering participation and achieving victory but also in shaping a healthy, disciplined, and intelligent society. Success in sports brings honor and pride to the country, while participation promotes a healthier nation, creating individuals with discipline, strong personality, and sound mental health.

However, inefficient management and political interference have become significant barriers to the growth of the sports sector. The current disorganized system has allowed certain sports and athletes to fall under the control of private entities. Additionally, a substantial portion of resources and services are concentrated in urban areas, leaving athletes in rural and estate sectors neglected.

Despite the immense potential that sports offer to a country like Sri Lanka—one that has faced numerous challenges—the nation's position in the international sports arena remains low. Although Sri Lankan cricket once enjoyed a prominent status, it has recently seen a decline. The NPP is committed to implementing a sports and physical well-being policy that will restore national pride and cultivate a healthy and disciplined populace.

## 1.5 A rich cultural life - A compassionate society

### Introduction

The cultural and artistic space is a highly sensitive area within a society. Though culture and art seem to take time to have an impact on the human community, the decline in these areas has caused a significant erosion in contemporary Sri Lankan society. The intentional destruction of the foundation of culture and arts has weakened civil society. Several past governments have neglected the cultural sector. The educational framework, which should have been effectively developed and maintained from early childhood, has often fallen victim to shifts in political power. As a result, society's failure to cultivate a developed cultural life has led individuals to fall short of becoming complete and empowered citizens, even after progressing through stages such as preschool, school, technical college, and university. This failure has led to a loss of faith in the belief that culture is the root of human life.

This field of culture is shaped by the interplay of interconnected domains, including education, art, media, and religious beliefs. The long-term decline of these areas has given rise to numerous social issues, such as excessive competition, restlessness, stress, suicides, dissatisfaction, violence, environmental neglect, and a diminished sense of dignity. Society is now calling for a new vision that can swiftly address these wounds and bring about essential changes. Such a transformation can only be realized through a robust revitalization of the cultural sector, aimed at fostering a national revival. The National People's Power movement aspires to create a new cultural individual or cultured person —one that is free, critical, respectful of human dignity, and embraces diverse cultures.

## 1.6 A conserved history - Innovating across Heritage

### Introduction

In Sri Lanka, the current understanding of history, culture, and heritage is often based on post-colonial perspectives, which have limited the effective use of these elements for national development. Therefore, creating a new policy framework with an innovative vision is essential to effectively utilize these fields. Establishing new policy foundations based on research and development is a high priority for integrating history, culture, and heritage into the country's national development strategies. This process aims to utilize Sri Lanka's rich heritage in a sustainable and comprehensive manner for development.

### Principles

- Protection of Cultural Resources
- Value of Cultural Heritage and History
- Social Innovation

### ACTIVITIES

## 1.7 A sustainable biotic world - An evergreen life

### Introduction

The total land area of Sri Lanka is 65,610 square kilometers. In addition to this, it encompasses a marine zone of 18,060 square kilometres, a neighbouring marine zone of 19,620 square kilometres, and an extended economic zone of 437,400 square kilometres.

According to the topography, the area up to 300 feet is classified as the coastal zone, while areas between 300 feet to 1,000 feet and above are categorized as mountainous regions. The annual rainfall varies from 900 millimetres to over 5,000 millimetres. The primary river systems are fed by 103 major rivers and 94 smaller rivers and streams. Due to the interconnections among environmental systems, the entire land area of Sri Lanka can be considered a single ecosystem. The fertile soil layer and plant-animal species of which, about 25% to 30% is identified endemic are unique features.

Despite this, Sri Lanka has been unsuccessful in creating an environment-friendly and economically developed society. For over 20 years, it has been unsuccessful in defining the marine zone in the environmentally important continental pool under the exclusive economic zone, which is more than 20 times larger than Sri Lanka. Despite being a signatory Country to many of the international Conventions and Treaties and also having more than 100 environmental laws in the country, it has failed to build up an environmentally
---
friendly nation. Due to the lack of proper land-use planning, the land is turning into barren land with soil erosion and landslides. The absence of proper water management has caused severe water shortages and disasters from excess water as well. Doubling evaporation rates over a short period of 30 years, the destruction of water resources, and other environmental factors directly affecting these resources are considered major issues.

The environmental policy of the NPP with the vision of "a sustainable environment that ensures the healthy existence of biodiversity" gives priority to the use of natural resources ensuring the balance between socio-economic development and the environment, a participatory approach in sustainable management, minimizing climate change impacts, and a healthy society with a balanced environment built upon knowledge, skills, attitudes and mindset.

## Principles

- Environmental justice and fairness

## 1.8 Free media industry - An objectively informed society

### Introduction

Human communication is inherently linked and has evolved over time into a dominant social process, closely intertwined with modern technology. Mass media represents the modern state of this long-standing evolution. The term 'media' encompasses the technical methods, tools, institutions, technical procedures, organizational structures, and other elements used to disseminate various messages to the public. It is the means through which broad objectives such as information providing, education, persuasion, entertainment, social adaptation, cultural promotion, and mutual co-existence are achieved. The effectiveness of journalism relies on the integrity and quality of all these components.

The media process should be tailored to the specific needs of a country, society, or community. Therefore, policies and initiatives that establish its foundation are crucial. Since gaining independence in 1948, successive governments in Sri Lanka have used print and electronic media as the mechanism to maintain their power. Consequently, instead of delivering accurate, truthful, and clear news, the media in the country has increasingly focused on promoting pro-government narratives, eulogies and personal biases. The challenge is that news and feature programs filled with deception, misrepresentation, and biased attitudes have fueled mistrust, suspicion, and conflict among ethnic groups. As journalists increasingly became political partisans more focused on profit and attention than integrity, public trust in the media began to erode.

The NPP is committed to preventing the deliberate and strategic misuse of mass media.

# A Vision of Peace and Freedom

This black and white image powerfully symbolizes themes of peace, freedom, and hope that are central to the political manifesto of Anura Kumara Dissanayaka from NPP for the Sri Lankan presidential election 2024.

The image depicts a large silhouette of a bird, likely a dove, in mid-flight with its wings spread wide. This central figure dominates the frame, representing the aspirations for peace and progress that the candidate aims to bring to Sri Lanka.

Surrounding this main bird are several smaller birds in flight, suggesting a collective movement towards a common goal. This could symbolize the unity and collective action needed to achieve the vision set forth in the manifesto.

In the foreground, two human hands are visible, reaching upwards towards the birds. These hands appear to be releasing or welcoming the birds, which could represent:

1. The government's role in facilitating peace and freedom for its citizens
2. The people's embrace of new policies and changes
3. The act of letting go of past conflicts and moving towards a brighter future

The use of silhouettes and the black and white format creates a stark, dramatic effect that emphasizes the symbolic nature of the image. The contrast between light and shadow adds depth and emotion to the scene.

This powerful visual metaphor encapsulates key themes likely to be found in the manifesto:

- Peace and reconciliation
- Freedom and democracy
- Hope for the future
- Unity and collective progress
- Government's role in uplifting its citizens

The image serves as a striking introduction to the political vision of the candidate, setting a tone of optimism and transformative change for Sri Lanka.

## 02. An honourable life - A safe country

### 2.1 A safe society - An enriched nation

#### Introduction

Approximately 5.7 million people in Sri Lanka live below the national poverty line (set at Rs. 16,326 per month as of May 2024 as confirmed by the Department of Census and Statistics. A report published by the United Nations Development Programme indicates that more than half of the population (55.7%), which is about 12.34 million people, are exposed to multidimensional poverty. This reflects a significant challenge: since gaining independence, the political parties in power have left a social legacy where a substantial portion of the population remains poor and suffers from multidimensional vulnerabilities.

Since independence, every government elected to power has implemented various social protection and welfare programs aimed at alleviating poverty. While these programs provide financial and/or livelihood support to the needy, these programmes suffer from several inherent weaknesses, such as inefficiency, high administrative costs, lack of transparency in the selection of beneficiaries, failure to reach the intended recipients, political interference, and delays in payments etc. As a result, successive governments have failed to provide adequate and strong social protection and welfare to those in need.

The NPP views social protection and welfare as a core responsibility of the state. Given the current economic conditions where a significant portion of the population lacks employment, business opportunities, and viable economic prospects, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive social protection program to rebuild the economy and society. The objective of the NPP's social protection and welfare programs is to improve the living standards of those entitled to welfare benefits and to enable them to become active participants in the economy quickly. We aspire to provide "a universal social protection system based on the life cycle approach for all Sri Lankans."

#### Principles

- Social solidarity
- Social empowerment
- Financial grants to those in need
- Inter-ministerial coordination
- Life cycle based social protection for all
- Ensuring social justice and leaving no one behind
- Efficient and meaningful participation of beneficiaries and all relevant stakeholders in the selection of beneficiaries

# 2.2 An efficient workforce - A respectable professional life

## Introduction

Human labor is both a key factor of production and a driving force in social development. However, in modern society, the status and importance that should be accorded to the worker have been devalued. Despite the critical role that both trained and untrained workers play in the production process, many workers find themselves in situations where they do not receive even a minimum living wage. As a result, most of the labor force faces harsh experiences in their economic, social, and cultural lives. The goal of this initiative is to establish a system where labor is respected and valued appropriately, by fostering humane employer-employee relationships that ensure equality and recognition for workers of all levels.

## Principles

- Protection of the dignity and the value of labor

## 2.3 Impartial Human Identity
### Gender Equality in social-life

### Introduction

Although women are an integral part of society, they consistently occupy an unequal position due to marginalization within major socio-economic, cultural, and political systems. This inequality occurs across all sectors, including the home, community, workplace, and politics. In recent decades, the situation has worsened due to neoliberal economic policies. Despite women being the primary earners of foreign remittances, the necessary structural and ideological changes for equality and justice have not yet taken place. Instead, the commodification of women's identities and their marginalization in the labor market have intensified.

Overall, factors such as the marginalization of both women and men as vulnerable workers, the direct impact on women due to the weakening of public services like education and healthcare, and the enactment of laws controlling women's bodies amidst militarization and ethno-religious extremism highlight women's issues as a broader social crisis. Therefore, the current issues faced by women in Sri Lanka must be understood through an intersectional perspective. The NPP proposes a political practice that represents all marginalized groups in society, aiming to realize the aspirations of a just society, a free country, and free women by securing all rights. Hence, its policies on women are intrinsically linked to its other policies.

Gender identities and sexual orientations are diverse. However, in Sri Lanka, these groups often face violence, marginalization, and stigmatization. Additionally, outdated colonial laws, institutional frameworks, and regressive cultural beliefs contribute to the denial of justice to these communities. In a just society that treats everyone equally, no group should be marginalized because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.

### Principles

- Economic justice as a cornerstone for achieving gender equality.
- State policies acknowledging the value of unpaid care work within the national economy.
---

## 2.4 A safe world for children
### A creative future generation

### Introduction

By 2023, Sri Lanka's population was 22,037,000 and 6,642,331, which is 30.14% of the total population, were children under 18 years of age, according to the definition of the United Nations. Today, children face significant issues such as weak justice systems, inadequate protection services, educational challenges, and malnutrition. The judicial process for children who fall victim to crimes often drags on for excessively long periods, sometimes extending even 6 to 10 years.

Currently, the Department of Prisons transports children to and from court alongside adult offenders, endangering their safety and privacy. Decades-old laws like the Vagrants Ordinance, which has been in force since colonization, continue to infringe on individuals' freedom of movement, violating the rights of children and their families. A comprehensive review of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, which has undergone only minor amendments over the decades, is also necessary.

Education is crucial in developing the skills and mindset needed for children's success in a rapidly changing world, but Sri Lanka's current education system is failing to meet this need. The frustrations and lack of trust in the future caused by corruption and bribery in the country have driven many young people to seek opportunities abroad.

The absence of a well-organized and adequate human and physically resourceful social service system in Sri Lanka has made child welfare a significant challenge. Although field officers are assigned to social protection and related duties, gaps in identifying and assisting at-risk children and families have weakened the services. The NPP's policy on child protection and welfare presents a comprehensive approach to ensure the safety of children in Sri Lanka through increased budget allocations, improved health and safety measures, legal reforms, and advancement of education.
---

## Activities

- Reviewing, amending, or repealing outdated laws such as the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, Adoption of Children Ordinance, Vagrants Ordinance, and Orphanages Ordinance.
- Establishing specialized high courts dedicated solely to handling cases involving children
- Setting up a more efficient mechanism for collecting child victims' testimonies and improving the current investigative process to minimize their re-victimization.
- Direct children accused of minor offenses to intervention and community-based rehabilitation programs instead of the court system.
- Providing family-based care and support to identify at-risk children and prevent unnecessary separation from their families.
- Implementing a child-friendly transportation system to ensure safe and dignified transportation of children for legal purposes.
- Streamlining coordination between the National Child Protection Authority and agencies such as Probation and Child Protection Services and capacity building of those agencies.

## 2.5 A contented Youth – Cultured, Independent Thinkers

### Introduction

In Sri Lanka, 38% of the total population, that is approximately 8.5 million individuals belong to young generation. Since the independence, youth in Sri Lanka have experienced unsatisfactory lives. Particularly over the last seven decades, the prevailing political system and culture have prevented them from effective political participation. The three major uprisings in the North and South in recent decades, during which hundreds of thousands of young people lost their lives, were driven by the unfulfilled dreams of a youth that the political establishment failed to satisfy.

Contributing factors to this discontent include limited educational opportunities, restricted access to economic participation, insufficient opportunities for youth to engage in technological and communication advancements, the inability to live as equal members of society without being subjected to external pressures, and the lack of means to live with dignity and respect. The massive youth-led people's struggle of 2022, which arose against economic hardship is one that extended beyond mere economic demands to call for a systemic change within the country. However, the core objectives of this movement were not achieved. All this highlight that the youth has represented and still represent a marginalized and overlooked group, despite being the most capable and powerful force that could contribute to the future development of the country.

### Principles

- Youth who are actively involved in the economic process
- Freedom from oppression, exploitation, and discriminatory practices
- Contribution to social development
- Advancement of science and modern technology, with a desire to overcome societal challenges
- Youth capable of providing leadership in political, social, and economic processes
- A vibrant cultural life and independent thinking
- A skilled youth capable of assuming national and international leadership
- Youth who stands against social injustice

# 2.6 A respectable senior citizen- A meaningful retirement

## Introduction

Taking care of the elderly is a responsibility of the children and relatives within a family and is a cultural value. The elderly, who have contributed to the socio-economic development of their families and communities for most of their lives, deserve care and attention during their later years. In 2023, the population of senior citizens in Sri Lanka (those aged 60 and above) was 3.7 million, representing 17.2% of the total population. By 2045, this percentage is projected to rise to 21%. While some policymakers view the increasing elderly population as a challenge, the NPP believes that it is a national responsibility to understand and address this situation with special attention to the well-being of the elderly.

## ACTIVITIES

## 2.7 An unimpaired social life - A fair and equitable approach

### Introduction

At some point in their lives, everyone is likely to experience difficulties functioning normally, especially as they age. When a family member is born with a disability or acquires one during childhood, adolescence, or old age, it can be a painful experience. Therefore, it is essential to take steps to empower people with disabilities and ensure an environment where they can fully participate in society. There is a higher prevalence of people with disabilities among the lower socio-economic strata and in rural areas, where adequate facilities are often lacking. In Sri Lanka, approximately 8.7% of the total population consists of people with disabilities.

The NPP recognizes and upholds the rights of persons with disabilities to live with equal rights, such as access to education and vocational training, employment, transportation, and public services.

# 03. A modern life A wealthy nation

## 3.1 A Democratic Economy - An affluent country

### Introduction

The quality of life and socio-cultural development of citizens of a country depends on correct economic policies adopted and actions taken. The destructive economic policies and corrupt political culture followed by the leaders of the country have left us today with a battered and crippled economy and society where human lives have been shattered in every aspect.

The total government debt, Rs. 310,779 million in 1990, increased to Rs. 28,695,950 million by 2023, pushing the entire nation into a debt trap. Between 2015 and 2019 alone, the total debt increased by Rs. 13,031,543 million, reflecting a 74% increase. Additionally, there was a staggering debt growth of 51.43% in 2022 compared to 2021. As of March 31, 2024, the total public debt has reached Rs. 28,013,560 million, which exceeded USD 100,000 million.

However, due to the misappropriation of borrowed funds and the failure to invest them in economically productive projects, the economy did not grow in corresponding to the increase in debt. The annual economic growth decreased from 5% to -0.2% between 2015 and 2019 and it was -2.3% in 2023.

Weak tax administration, inefficiency, corruption, granting tax benefits to cronies, tax avoidance, and tax evasion have led to a significant decline in government tax revenue as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By December 2023, the total tax defaults alone exceeded Rs. 1,100,000 million. The government's stance has been to impose more taxes on people, cut essential public expenditure, and sell off public assets without considering the negative consequences of the decline in the demand for goods and services and the disposable income of people.

Despite continued rhetoric about controlling inflation, the reality is that the prices of goods and services have risen to unaffordable levels. The ultimate result is that people's real income has gone down so low that basic human needs cannot be fulfilled. As a result of destructive politics, about 26% of the population has been dragged below the poverty line.

The external sector of the economy also continues to weaken due to the arbitrary use of foreign reserves, weak foreign exchange management, the inability to refinance foreign debt caused by the continuous downgrading of the credit rating of the country, the inability to attract foreign investment, rising import expenditure, and stagnant export earnings. Even foreign reserves at the end of May 2024 stood at USD 5.4 billion (including USD 1.5 billion SWAP loan facilities provided by the People's Bank of China), it was mainly an outcome of unpaid interest, debt instalments in arrears, import restrictions, remittances from overseas Sri Lankans, and receipt of IMF extended fund facility, rather than a result of proactive and sustainable measures of the government.
---
Inequality in income distribution has also been widening. The bottom 20% of households receive only 4.6% of the national income, while the top 20% get 51.4% of the income.

The NPP's economic policy framework focuses on economic democracy and is integrated with a human resource development plan and a technological development roadmap to ensure equitable opportunities in economic activities, participation in the economic decision making process with an equal say, and a fair share of economic benefits, has been developed based on ten key principles to achieve sustainable economic growth and development, aiming a Real GDP target of USD 120 billion by 2030 through a resilient production economy.

In formulating these policies, factors such as resource availability and accessibility, outcomes of research and development activities, socially embedded knowledge, civilization process, biodiversity, technology, strategic location of the country and the nature of diplomatic relations have been considered.

## Principles

- Priority for humanity
- Economic democracy
- People's participation, equitable and inclusive society
- Food security
- Fair share of economic benefits
- Sustainable resource utilization
- Non-commodified public services and social security

## 3.2 High productivity - Nation with food security

### Introduction

Currently, the agricultural sector contributes 8.4% to GDP, while employment in this sector accounts for approximately 27%. Additionally, 15.3% of export revenue is generated from agricultural crops. This highlights the significant role agriculture plays in Sri Lankan society.

With rapid population growth, traditional technologies alone became insufficient to produce the required amount of food for the population, prompting Sri Lanka to adopt modern technological methods. These efforts enabled the country to meet the target of producing 2.4 million metric tons of rice necessary for the population. However, some shortsighted policies implemented during past administrations have challenged domestic rice production. Farmers struggle to receive a fair price for their harvests, while consumers find purchasing preferred rice varieties at affordable prices difficult.

Increasing the production of high-quality vegetables and fruits has become a challenge, with approximately 30% of the total vegetable and fruit production being lost post-harvest. Looking at the other field crop sector, the country spent about USD 400 million on imports in 2022 alone. Additionally, the production of foreign exchange-earning crops such as tea, coconut, rubber, export-oriented crops, and specialty crops has declined. The wrong agricultural policies and actions of past governments, along with the failure to adopt appropriate technologies, have contributed to these issues.

As a result, the current agriculture sector in Sri Lanka faces several major challenges, including subsistence farming, minimal mechanization, high production costs, insufficient prices for production, high prices and price volatility of agricultural products, weak extension services, inadequate value addition, and low youth participation. This agricultural policy has been formulated after carefully considering the prevailing conditions, and it is expected that its implementation will yield an income of approximately LKR 3 million per acre annually. The policy aims to exceed 400 million metric tons in national tea production, increase the yield per coconut tree to 80 coconuts per annum, raise the rubber yield to 1,300 kilograms per hectare per year, and achieve a paddy yield of 6 metric tons per hectare.

# 3.3 High-quality livestock production - An entrepreneurial approach

## Introduction

The livestock sector plays a vital role in providing essential proteins and other nutrients to the people of Sri Lanka. Additionally, it significantly strengthens the national economy and improves livelihoods through import substitution. The sustainability of the livestock industry depends on factors such as production capacity, the number of livestock farms, infrastructure, the labour force, and the availability of policymakers, administrators, researchers, and other stakeholders.

However, livestock production in Sri Lanka has not yet reached the desired levels, and the sector faces numerous challenges. These include severe shortages of quality animal food and breeding materials, high prevalence of animal diseases, weak supply chains and services related to production, unethical and imbalanced markets, lack of organized value chain developments and proper livestock extension programs, inadequate health services, poor management of breeding activities, minimal research interventions, limited access to credit and insurance facilities, and insufficient incentives and guidance for stakeholders. These challenges contribute to the inefficiency within Sri Lanka's livestock sector.

## 3.4 A sustainable management - A quality marine resource

### Introduction

The need for protein has been identified as a major component in human nutrition, with fish and related products recognized as a high-quality, safe source of protein. Therefore, it is a national priority to strengthen fisheries and aquaculture to meet the country's demand for fish. Fisheries, aquaculture, and related industries can also contribute to sectors such as gross domestic production, food security, job creation, uplifting the socio-economic status of people, and earning foreign exchange.

The fisheries in Sri Lanka can be divided into main categories: seawater fisheries and freshwater fisheries and the aquaculture industry. The ocean region of Sri Lanka encompasses a unique economic zone of 517,000 square kilometers. It also consists of a local waterbody of 21,500 square kilometers, lagoons and estuaries covering 1,580 square kilometers, and reservoirs spanning 5,200 square kilometers. Currently, around 225,000 individuals in Sri Lanka engage in seawater fisheries, while approximately 90,650 are involved in freshwater fisheries. In the year 2000 the fisheries and related industries contributed 2.7%. to the country's GDP. But this has now decreased to 1.2%. Our annual per capita fish consumption, which was 17.2 kilograms in 2017, has now declined to 11.07 kilograms. This trend has adversely affected the health of people, especially children and pregnant mothers.

The fisheries and aquaculture sectors are currently facing many issues. Among them, the high expenditure on fuel and other resources, the government's lack of interventions to introduce better technology and techniques, illegal fishing activities by foreign vessels, an outdated legal framework and processes, and insufficient incentives for sustainable and eco-friendly techniques are the primary concerns. The main aims of this policy framework include the development and management of the fisheries in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner through proper scientific techniques and practical methods, thereby increasing fish products and making them available to consumers at a reasonable price, as well as uplifting the living standards of those engaged in fisheries.

### Principles

- Fish food Security
- Participatory approach and sustainable management
- Strong legal framework in line with standards and international agreements
- Safe and sustainable practices through standardization and incentives
- Prevention of environmental pollution, and protection of oceans

## 3.8 An entrepreneurship explosion - An organic approach

### Introduction

In comparison to other developing nations, Sri Lanka has not been able to reach its potential in industrial development when compared to countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and South Korea who have significantly expanded their share of the global product and service market by consistently growing their gross domestic products (GDP). In 2023, the GDPs of Bangladesh, Vietnam, and South Korea reached USD 460 billion, USD 409 billion, and USD 1,700 billion, respectively, while Sri Lanka's GDP was only USD 84 billion. Moreover, these countries generated export revenues of USD 59 billion, USD 384 billion, and USD 808 billion, respectively, whereas Sri Lanka's merchandise export revenue was just USD 17.3 billion. This disparity highlights Sri Lanka's critical challenge in goods and services production, which stems from the lack of a comprehensive plan to enhance production capabilities and the failure to leverage advanced global technologies for productive growth.

Therefore, we consider Sri Lanka must enhance local production and transition to an export-driven economy to navigate the current economic crisis successfully.

# 3.9 A sustainable resource utilization - Generation of the highest benefits

## Introduction

Sri Lanka has an abundance of mineral resources, accumulated throughout the land space of 65,610 square kilometers. The peninsular basin, which is about twenty times the land area and including the ocean region which will be nominally granted according to the UN ocean laws, is also rich in ocean minerals. Varieties of ores of minerals such as graphite, mica, apatite, lime and dolomite, mineral sand, quartz and silica sand, feldspar, serpentine, laterite, different clay types, and gems which had been created because of different geological factors are abundantly found in Sri Lanka. Many industries such as mineral sand, cement, phosphate, ceramic, glass, and roof tiles were originated from mineral resources discovered through the mineral resource expeditions in the 1980s. Since then, minerals have been sold as raw material without any value additions, and many of these industries have either been sold out or closed by now.

Sri Lanka has been famous since ancient times as a country abundant with variety of gems. There is an immense potential to make Sri Lanka a main centre in the global gem market by capturing a considerable portion of the global gem market using the presence of individuals who possess both traditional and modern technologies about the gem industry, the availability of university-level programmes, and the unique location of Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka has been able to earn only USD 250 million a year from the gem and jewelry industry. Issues such as the lack of state sponsorship to the industry, laws and regulations not being updated, corruption and bribery due to political interventions, officials not possessing enough knowledge on the field, and the absence of proper lab facilities and a systematic evaluation mechanism are main reasonings for this situation.

There is an ability to start industries that can provide a considerable support to the national economy using lime, calcite and dolomite, mineral sand and quarts, and silica which possess graphite, apatite, calcium carbonate. There are possibilities to develop industries based on value added products from ores that contain iron and copper, as well as other small mineral ores discovered so far. Moreover, mineral resources on land and seabed can be discovered and their mineral ores and rare earth elements (REE) can be used to earn foreign exchange.

## Principles

- Scientific exploration
- Sustainable excavations and usage
- Optimum utilization
- Maximum benefits from local and foreign markets
---
# ACTIVITIES

Actions will be taken to gradually establish the following industries after conducting feasibility studies about the mineral related resources.

- Exploring mineral ores and REEs within the country and in the seabed using developed technology.

# 3.10 A secured energy centre - A sustainable revenue source

## Introduction

The global energy sector is in the midst of atransformative era, driven by sustainability andinnovation.With evolving consumption patternsand regulatory frameworks, the shift towardcleaner energy sources is accelerating. Electricitygeneration from solar and wind energy, along withadvanced energy storage solutions, is growingrapidly, accelerated by global commitments toreduce greenhouse gas emissions and the fallingcosts of these technologies. Additionally, lowemission technologies such as green hydrogenandsmall modular reactor technologies are gainingsignificant traction. Decreasing costs of batteryproductionare catalysing the electrification of theglobal transportation sector. Electrification of allforms of energy consumption is seen as a vitalstrategy to achieve
---
# Energy Policy and Action Plan

Net-zero emission targets are driving an urgent need to rapidly transform the electricity grid into a smart grid. Fossil fuels continue to play a significant role in meeting global energy demands, with ongoing discussions about minimizing their environmental impact. Maintaining a strategic energy mix is crucial for navigating geopolitical disruptions. Natural gas, viewed as a cleaner and transitional energy source, plays a key role in the shift toward renewable energy. International investments in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and exploration of new natural gas reserves are expanding in response to its importance in the global energy landscape.

Amidst these global trends, Sri Lanka remains burdened with some of the highest electricity prices in the region. To emerge from the economic abyss caused by decades of mismanagement, the country must transition to a manufacturing economy. However, high electricity prices pose a significant obstacle. The primary reason for the elevated electricity prices is the heavy reliance on oil-based generation. Previous regimes, rather than making timely investments in low-cost energy sources, repeatedly opted for short-term fixes by contracting oil-based power stations.

We present the policy and action plan of the National People's Power, which prioritises transitioning to an energy mix that is the least dependent on oil-based electricity generation, with a significant increase in renewable energy to foster a green economy. This policy includes strategies to revive and enhance the ailing refinery, national storage and distribution infrastructure for oil, ensuring an undisrupted energy supply. While addressing these challenges, Sri Lanka's energy sector will be transformed into a competitive and transparent industry, equipped with modern technology and focused on customer empowerment. This comprehensive policy and action plan aim to drive Sri Lanka towards socio-economic progress and expand its share in the global economy, while safeguarding the environment for future generations.

## Principles

- Energy as an essential national service
- Sustainable and secure energy supply and consumption
- Energy economy as a source of foreign income

## Activities

- Electricity prices will be gradually lowered toward the lowest in the region within five years by implementing competitive procurement practices, prioritising solar and wind energy projects with the goal of reducing dependence on oil-based generation.
- Existing electricity tariff methodology and the pricing formulae for LPG and oil will be revised, establishing a fairer and fully transparent price revision mechanism.
- The tax structure will be simplified to avoid tax pyramiding to ensure clarity for consumers.
- A rapid national program will be launched to add 2,000 MW of solar PV capacity within the next five (5) years, as a strategic measure to avert the impending energy crisis in the near future.
---
# Energy Policy

- Rooftop solar PV and behind-the-meter battery energy storage systems will be promoted by introducing new business models and tariff structures, aiming to reduce the overall cost of electricity generation.

- It will be ensured that the benefits of solar power will reach all customers by promoting connected microgrids based on smart grid concepts run by community energy cooperatives and aggregators. This smart grid infrastructure will be utilised to enable greater absorption of renewable energy to the grid.

- The smart grid will be leveraged to enable customers to provide demand response and flexibility services to the grid, ensuring they receive fair compensation for their contributions to manage the grid.

- Wind energy is a natural resource Sri Lanka is blessed with owing to its location. It will be ensured that the benefits of wind energy will be fairly distributed to the people of Sri Lanka by implementing competitive procurement practices for wind energy projects.

- A state agency on green hydrogen will be established, bringing together experts from academia and industry to facilitate and attract global leaders in the sector. This agency will focus on setting up pilot projects and preparing for the technology, enabling green hydrogen to become a significant part of the economy as soon as it achieves price parity.

- Feasibility studies on pumped hydro storage, battery energy storage systems and hybrid systems will be expeditiously completed, to enhance the absorption of renewable energy. New business models will be developed and implemented to attract investments in these projects and technologies.

- LNG is recognized as a clean energy source that can aid the transition to a renewable energy future. The importation of LNG will be facilitated through a competitively procured terminal and fuel sources to supply 1,500 MW of existing thermal power plants that are capable of being switched to LNG.

- Many of the early power purchase agreements of mini hydropower and other renewable energy plants are reaching their end of term over the coming years. A mechanism will be established to renew these agreements, striking a balance between ensuring the benefits flow to public to whom the natural resources belong and protecting the capital invested by the project developer by ensuring a fair operating fee.

- Steps will be taken to increase the forest cover across all hydropower catchment areas after conducting scientific and economic studies to identify the potential, impacts and feasibility.

- As the technology of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) is rapidly advancing, it is important to prepare to adopt the technology, immediately after becoming feasible for Sri Lanka. With that aim, agreements will be signed with countries and organisations leading in the technology to develop required human resources, physical facilities, standards and regulatory frameworks.

- Review of feasibility studies for modernising the existing refinery or building a new refinery, will be expedited.

- These studies will adopt a holistic, integrated approach, focusing on using refinery by-products to fuel the manufacturing economy and training a competent workforce for the international market.

- All existing agreements regarding the Trincomalee oil tank farm will be revisited. The 24 tanks owned by CPC and the 61 tanks owned by the joint venture company will be reviewed.

## Energy and Infrastructure

will be promptly integrated into the economy through new business models to maximise their utility.

- By modernising the storage network and utilising rail transport, a continuous supply of fuel will be guaranteed, even during crises or periods caused by weather or geopolitical turbulence.

- The dilapidated pipeline between Colombo Port and the Kolonnawa terminal will be upgraded to a system capable of loading and unloading various petroleum products. This upgrade will be funded by an investment from CPSTL.

- To fully capitalise on the commercial value of natural gas resources in Mannar and Kaveri basins, the commercialization and new exploration agreements with international partners will be expedited, ensuring transparency.

- Modern technology to forecast reservoir and fuel storage levels and risk management tools will be leveraged to ensure a continuous supply of electricity and petroleum fuels to sustain a resilient economy, with government intervention.

- Sri Lanka's commitment to achieving the 2050 Net Zero Emission Targets will be further strengthened. The nation's honour on the international stage will be reinstated by updating the inadequate short-term commitments made by previous regimes, with the support of both local and expatriate Sri Lankan scientific communities.

- The necessary restructuring of the electricity and petroleum sectors will be conducted methodically, following comprehensive stakeholder consultations and evidence-based reform strategies.

- A special bureau will be established to attract and facilitate public, private, and international investments in the electricity and petroleum sector, in alignment with a methodically developed Long Term Energy Supply Plan. This bureau will also be responsible for reviewing progress and managing risks associated with these investments.

- Actions to minimise technical losses and inefficiencies in institutional management of power systems will be enforced via the PUCSL. A mechanism to compensate customers for loss of service will be instituted using industry accepted indices in the long run.

- Customers, including low income households and small and medium enterprises, whose electricity supply remains disconnected due to non-payment of exorbitant bills unjustly imposed over 2022-2024 will be reconnected, with remaining dues charged on a fair instalment plan. Additionally, fees for new connections to small households will also have the option of an instalment plan to expand access to electricity.

- With the support of relevant ministries, a national programme will be launched to provide electricity supply schemes incorporating self-generation and energy conservation programs for government hospitals, schools and religious premises to minimise their dependance on subsidies provided through public taxes.

- The transport sector, currently reliant on fossil fuels, will be systematically transitioned to electric mobility, based on clean and green energy.

- To achieve this, the national transportation plan, national electric mobility plan, and the renewable energy development plan will be integrated. A national e-mobility secretariat will be established to develop a national EV charging network, hub-and-spoke smart city transportation networks, and other infrastructure, along with tax incentive schemes.
---
## Energy Sector Reforms and Initiatives

- A statutory body will be established to advise the state on investment, trading, and future directions in global energy markets based on international data. This body will also facilitate energy trading businesses.

- A national strategy to establish Sri Lanka as an Energy Trading Hub will be prepared and implemented.

- A secure digital platform will be established to implement a transparent, efficient and competitive tendering and procurement system for the electricity and petroleum sector.

- A digital platform integrated with the local banking system will be established to capture all energy transactions, from fuel importation and power generation to end-user bill payments. This platform will be used to implement targeted incentive programs for the industrial and commercial sectors, ensure timely payments to suppliers, and provide social safeguards for vulnerable customers.

- An incentive mechanism will be introduced to conduct energy audits to enhance the energy conversion efficiency in power generation and industrial processes.

- Energy audits of large-scale industrial and commercial consumers will be mandated to enhance the energy efficiency and conservation, while upgrading and enforcing minimum energy performance standards of industrial equipment, buildings and all appliances.

- It is becoming essential to disclose and minimise emissions related to products and services when competing in sophisticated international markets. Therefore, an agency will be established to monitor and certify Green Energy usage in the energy portfolio to support local industries that export products to international markets.

- In the global effort to achieve climate targets, a skilled and competent human resource is crucial. Sri Lanka's workforce, equipped with energy-related skills, will be seen as an opportunity to contribute to these global efforts and as a means to earn foreign income. The training divisions of the Ceylon Electricity Board and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation will be integrated with the local university system and other vocational training institutions to provide skills required for the global energy sector.

- Productive R&D collaborations will be promoted among national higher educational institutes and other stakeholders, such as energy utilities, regulators, and the industry, when implementing development projects in the energy sector.

- Barriers to local companies in the electricity and petroleum sector will be removed, and their participation and investments for non-conventional renewable energy projects will be promoted.

- Local companies will be encouraged to form partnerships with international companies to facilitate technology transfer and attract investments.

- These companies will be able to leverage the experience and qualifications gained through participation in national energy projects to compete in the international markets. They will be further supported through internal and diplomatic mechanisms.

# 3.11 A good public transportation service
## Speedy final destination

### Introduction

Unsystematic and inefficient transport has wasted a considerable amount of time of most of the public. Heavy traffic, wasting a lot of time on the road, transport services not working at night, too many road accidents, and sexual and other harassment faced by women and children in public services characterises our passenger transport service. The reporting of around 30,000 road accidents a year is an indication of the lack of safety and its intensity in the transport sector. The contribution of the railway service has dropped to 5% in the transport sector. The portion of the SLTB in bus passenger service has dropped to 14%. Around 55% of the citizens opt to use private vehicles to fulfil their transport needs due to the decline in public transport, and they have to spend a large amount of their income on transport as a result. It has also resulted in high road traffic.

88,200 km of the entire 119,382 km road network of Sri Lanka belongs to local government institutes, and many roads at the rural and semi-urban areas are in a dilapidated state due to lack of maintenance. A large amount of money flows out annually to import fuel, and around 65% of the fuel burned in the country are spent in the transport sector. It thereby contributed to half of the air pollution. Further, around 35% of fruits and vegetables go into waste due to unsatisfactory transportation.

National People's Power wishes to establish an efficient, trustworthy, safe, and dignified people-oriented transport service with the long-term vision to gradually transform it into an eco-friendly system. Hence the goal is to provide 70% of the public's transport needs through public transportation within 5 years.

# 3.12 A sustainable marine resource - Acquiring a portion of global maritime business

## Introduction

Sri Lanka plays a big role in the global nautical field based on its strategic location at a centre where Eastern and Western sea routes meet. Yearly, thousands of tons of goods are transported by ships that sail past our country. The Colombo Harbour is located at an ideal spot to conduct this sea transportation, while the Hambantota Harbour, located in the South, operates much lower than its capacity. There is potential to develop the Colombo and Hambantota ports as two of the biggest naval centres in the world by attracting a considerable portion of the global maritime industry, providing competitive services and investing in infrastructure. The main ports of Colombo, Galle, Hambantota, and Trincomalee greatly contribute to the country's business and economic development and affect a large portion of the country's market.

Sri Lanka's sailors hold world fame for their excellence, skill, and performance, and they are a main resource in our nautical field. There is a considerable potential to earn foreign exchange and create job opportunities with high benefit for the country's youth, through the development of the number of professional sailors in Sri Lanka. This proposed policy framework brings balanced access to the development of the industry and the contribution of different stakeholders, including the harbour, nautical companies, and specialists, to bring Sri Lanka to the forefront of the global nautical field. We hope to make Sri Lanka a main nautical centre in the world through the country's location in the Indian Ocean, development of supply efficiency, and building a world-class maritime labour force.

## Principles

- An integrated maritime control for sustainable usage of maritime resources
- Being responsible and accountable for the protection of the maritime environment and resources

# 3.13 A secured data system- an ICT revolution

## Introduction

The global telecommunications sector is rapidly evolving with the integration of new technologies and innovative business models. Technologies like 5G wireless communication, cloud computing, decentralized telecom networks, mobile network services, and AI are driving the delivery of cutting-edge services to consumers. However, Sri Lanka has lagged behind in adopting these advancements at the same pace as global trends. Additionally, the high costs of telecommunication services negatively impact both local consumers and the industries that rely on these services.

## 3.14 A productive land management system
### Integrated control plan

### Introduction

According to the Land Commissioner Department, 82% of Sri Lanka's total land area, which stands at 6.6 million hectares, belongs to the government, while the remaining 18%, amounting to 1.2 million hectares, is private land. 32% of the 5.4 million hectares that belong to the state, which is 1.7 million hectares, are forests. In general, lands have been categorized as agricultural, commercial, or residential according to their usage for ease of administration and management.

The ordinances and regulations imposed during the colonial period to control land resources have made a significant impact on land management in Sri Lanka. The governments after the independence did not make any special effort to scientifically amend these laws for the well-being of the country and its people. Instead, some land reforms and policies aimed at land distribution, driven by narrow intentions, have contributed to socio-economic inequality. Issues related to land ownership have remained unresolved for a long time, leading to various social disparities.

# 3.15 A scientifically managed construction industry - Excellent quality workforce

## Introduction

The development and sustenance of the construction industry, which reflects the country's economic development, depend on state and private investment in infrastructure and projects. Before the 2022 downfall, the construction industry contributed 7% to the country's GDP and provided direct and indirect employment to over 1 million individuals. Despite the recent crisis, the industry has the potential for significant growth with the right investments and strategies.

Currently, most of the constructors and advisors in the field are from the private sector, and the construction companies owned by the government show less performance due to interventions and inefficient control.

Shortcomings in the procurement process, inefficiency, weak project management practices, political interventions, corruption, and the implementation of projects without proper financial support pose considerable challenges to the industry's stability. These issues hinder the performance of the construction projects, resulting in delays, excessive costs, and low-quality products. Further, outdated planning methods and standards, the inability to use new project management methods, and the lack of trained professionals negatively affect the industry. Job security and worker welfare in this field are not favourable.

Due to a lack of low-cost raw materials, new technological innovations, and limited investments in research and development, the industry has achieved only a tiny portion in the international arena. Further, brain drain has affected the industry's lack of trained labour, daily operations, and development.

Past governments invested loans from local banks and two-party and multi-party loans in construction projects, and the lack of benefits from these projects contributed greatly to the country's loan crisis.

The image shows a crowd gathered at what appears to be a political rally or public event. In the foreground, a young boy stands out, smiling brightly while holding a small flag. He is surrounded by adults, some of whom are wearing hats or head coverings. The crowd seems diverse, with people of different ages visible.

The atmosphere appears positive and energetic, with the boy's enthusiasm capturing the spirit of the event. In the background, more people can be seen, creating a sense of a large gathering. The image is in black and white, which gives it a timeless quality.

This scene could represent the grassroots support and community involvement in the political process, with multiple generations participating together. The presence of a child at the forefront symbolizes hope for the future and the importance of engaging youth in civic activities.

## 4.2. An efficient public service - A skill based professionalism

### Introduction

Sri Lanka's public service is the main instrument that implements state policies. The Sri Lankan government service, which consists of a 1.4 million workforce, consists of different professionals and officers from ministry secretaries to office support staff, and the state spends a considerable portion of its income on maintaining it. Even though it consists of officers with different educational and professional levels possessing other skills, at present, the government service has become inefficient, failing to fulfil public expectations and losing public faith.

The inefficiency of public service and the associated bribery, corruption, fraud, and misappropriation of public property are the inevitable results of the ruling class and the system. They are not tragedies brought by public servants on their own accord. The government service has faced grave dilapidation as a result of factors such as political appointments, manipulation of state workers for disastrous political decisions, and the employment of officers for the large-scale fraud and corruption of rulers, and this has been the basis of the public's loss of faith in the government service.

It is our aim to convert the government service to a satisfactory state instrument by freeing it from its current state and transforming it into a non-corrupted one which has the public faith and fulfils the public expectations.

### Principles

- Ensuring transparency and accountability

- Formulating productive policies
- Partnership
- Public participation, awareness, and skills
- Ensuring inclusion
- No discrimination

## 4.3 Rule of law governance - A judicial system with equal access

### Introduction

Independent and efficient administration of justice and public confidence in the process is crucial in establishing the rule of law. However, the public has lost its faith due to the allegations of undue influence, lack of independency and transparency, delays in the process and expensive nature of litigation in the judicial process. The National People's Power hopes to rebuild the broken public trust in it by creating an independent, efficient, transparent and affordable judicial system.
---
# Principles

## 4.4 Public security assuring - People friendly service

### Introduction

Police plays a very important role in maintaining law and order in the country as an institution close to the public. An important factor that reflects how the rule of law functions is the independent and efficient functioning of the police. However, at present, the public believes that the Sri Lanka Police is an institution from which it is impossible to get any service without political or other social connections or bribery. On the other hand, some police officers are also victims of political interference and are constantly suffering due to ill-treatment. The National People's Power expects to make the police service an independent, efficient, and friendly service that is closer to the public.
---
# Principles

## 4.5. A humanitarian prison - A lawful confinement

### Introduction

The vision of the Prisons Department in Sri Lanka is to social reintegration of inmates as good citizens through rehabilitation. But in the recent past, incidents of killing and inhumane torture of prisoners in various prisons show that people who are imprisoned face different forms of abuse. Also, there is a public opinion that powerful prisoners with certain political connections enjoy special privileges.

"Prisoners are also human" is only limited to a theme at present, and overcrowding and lack of basic facilities for prisoners are serious problems faced by prisons. The prison has become a place to punish prisoners rather than to reform them. Prisons at present have become criminal centres due to drug trafficking and underworld activities and have hindered the people who are serving their prison life with good behaviour.

The increase in the remand prisoner population is a major cause of prison overcrowding due to the long time it takes to complete legal proceedings. In 2022, there were 108,250 remand prisoners, 30,331 convicted prisoners, and a total of 138,581 prisoners living in prisons. Men show a higher tendency to be imprisoned than women, and the percentage of women among the total number of prisoners in 2022 was 3.23%. 19,094 or 62.95% of convicted prisoners were convicted of drug related charges. Further, 92% of the convicted prisoners had been educated up to G.E.C. O/L exam or less, while 62% were under 40.

Although it is the expectation of the National People's Power to create a social environment where people are not inclined to do crimes, we consider the welfare of the people serving prison sentences for any reason to be the responsibility of the government.

### Principles

- Guardianship and protection
- Rehabilitation and re-socializing

### ACTIVITIES

- Preventing all forms of torture inside prisons
- Analysing the nature, mental status, and other qualities of the prisoners, and categorizing and placing of prisoners accordingly
---
- Expanding facilities within prisons, including special facilities according to international standards

- Educational and vocational training courses in every prison
- Improving the efficiency of institutions involved in the criminal justice system to avoid prolonged detention as remand prisoners
- Paying special attention to the welfare of prisoners and preventing all form of violence against them in prisons
- Expanding education, health, and other services to children who live in prisons with their mothers

## 4.6. A drug-free country - A healthier citizen life

### Introduction

At present, drug use has become a social problem due to its rapid rise. Drug use has caused many serious problems in the family as well as in society. The tendency of schoolchildren to get addicted to drugs has increased.

The current regime has failed to control the importation and distribution of drugs into the country, and jailing drug users alone is not adequate to curbing this menace. Currently, drug use has created a social tragedy and in 2022, 152,979 people were arrested for drug offences. However, only 1930 people among these were referred to rehabilitation programmes. About 60% of the offenders who go to prison are in prison for drug-related offences. Sri Lanka has become a hub for drug trafficking in the region, under the protection of political and other forces, which has contributed to the growth of organized crime. Therefore, the National People's Power prioritizes drug prevention.

### ACTIVITIES

- An integrated operation to prevent drugs and organized crime in the country
- Establishment of a separate Bureau for Narcotics Prevention
- Development of naval and air surveillance facilities and provide modern equipment and training to officials to prevent the entry of drugs into the country
---

- Regularize rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts to free them from drug use

## 4.7 A dignified diplomacy - A sovereign state

### Introduction

Sri Lanka's strategic location at the center of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal has deep rooted historical antecedents. Archeological evidence provides ample materials to establish that Sri Lanka has had vibrant trade relations across the Bay of Bengal and with Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka's geostrategic location within the Indian Ocean is a blessing as the island is astride one of the world's busiest sea lanes of communication that connect East and West.

Developing Asia will be the world's largest region in terms of population. The region's share of world GDP will reach 30.5%, and Asia will essentially be a middle-income region by 2025. Sri Lanka has a history of leadership in foreign policy, grounded in the principle of non-alignment.

For the mutual growth along with the other countries of the region as well as for the National Security Foreign Policy play a crucial role. Factors that influence any State's foreign policy choices are geographical location, population, history, economic resources, ideology, government efficiency, quality of diplomacy, crisis and immediate events, technological advancements, international law and institutions, etc. However, we have observed in the recent past that the determinant of the foreign policy in Sri Lanka has mainly influenced by external factors and survival choices of ruling parties rather than the best interest of Sri Lankans. National interests should be the cornerstone of the foreign policy. Foreign policy reflects national interests and offers a perspective on human and global interests of a particular State.

When the current situation of Sri Lanka is considered, we are passing a period of worst economic crisis. One of the most important national interests of ours is to gradually withdraw from the debt crisis. Further domestic policy is formulated to protect and promote the national interest domestically within the country. A country's foreign policy is designed based on national strategy to protect and promote the national interests. Foreign and domestic policies are intertwined more closely than ever before. Sri Lanka's current foreign relations are influenced significantly by attempts to recover from the worst economic crisis in 2022 and stands as a challenge we should overcome. Rising geopolitical tension among international and regional powers in our region has become a key challenge to Sri Lanka's security and regional stability.

However, its geographical location as well as Sri Lanka's long invested diplomatic and cultural assets will become cornerstone our success. Comparatively higher human
---
Development indicators such as the level of education and health, education of women, etc. than other south Asian countries have provided Sri Lanka a relatively positive cultural level of the population which will be a pro factor for achieving ambitious Economic and foreign policy targets also.

Sri Lanka has important diplomatic recognition earned through some wise and correct actions of the past.

# 4.9 A Sri Lankan nation - The universal citizen

## Introduction

Sri Lanka is a country with people of various ethnicities such as Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, Malay and various religions such as Buddhist, Hindu, Islam, Christian, Catholic, etc. Because of that diversity, it is essential for the well-being and national unity of the country to live in a multicultural society that exists by nature, accepting and respecting each other. But the country has failed to build the Sri Lankan nation by taking advantage of the various opportunities in history. The country had to face a tragic war of 30 years as a result of creating mutual suspicion and mistrust and disunity between ethnicities and military groups for the sake of obtaining and maintaining power and narrow opportunistic political interests. The sorrows and sad results of that war still remain in Sri Lankan society. The National People's Power is dedicated to creating national unity for the building of the Sri Lankan nation, not divided based on ethnicity, language, religion, caste, or gender, and by respecting the diversity of identities and ensuring their survival and protection.

## Principles

- Political partnership of all ethnicities
- No citizen/community should be subjected to humiliation, oppression, degrading treatment or injustice on the basis of ethnicity, language, religion, caste, sex or any other grounds.

- A harmonious Sri Lankan nation undivided by racist, castes and religious ideologies

## ACTIVITIES

# Building a Unified Sri Lankan Nation

"A key initiative of the NPP will be the effort to build a unified Sri Lankan nation. The elite ruling class, which has governed the country until now, failed to unite the Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, and plantation communities under one flag as a Sri Lankan nation. Instead, they exacerbated conflicts between these groups to maintain their power. Our policies outline a range of material, structural, and operational interventions to address this. We will create space for all ethnicities to envision a shared future as a unified Sri Lankan nation. It is our goal to involve all communities in the process from designing a production economy to ensuring fair distribution of its benefits."
