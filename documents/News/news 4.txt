SJB indulging in cheap politics: Ruwan

Colombo, September 13 (Daily Mirror) -  Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is practising cheap politics by hurling a false allegation that there is a political deal between independent candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe and National People's Power (NPP) Candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said today.

“It is clear that the SJB is displaying political bankruptcy when one considers the kind of allegation its members are making,” Mr. Wijewardene told a media briefing.

“Anura Kumara Dissanayake is coming up with various statements from time to time. He tells the village people that an administration under him will have nothing to do with the IMF. However, he tells Colombo people that he will continue the engagement with the IMF. Why is this contradiction?” he asked.

“Some candidates are campaigning for change. The country cannot afford a change at this point in time. What the nation needs is economic stability. A change will destroy this stability. A so-called change would lead the country to another election in at least two years’ time. Another camp is trying to promote its team. There is no use of a good team if they don’t have a good leader to guide them. SJB has a good team, but they don’t have a good leader to guide them and the country,” he stressed.
