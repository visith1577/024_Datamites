Ruwan predicts another Presidential election in two years if Ranil loses

Colombo, September 06 (Daily Mirror) - Sri Lanka will have to go for another Presidential election in two years time if Ranil Wickremesinghe loses the Presidential election this month, UNP Deputy Leader Ruwan Wijewardene said today. 

"Sri Lanka will have to face another Presidential election if either Sajith Premadasa or Anura Kumara Dissanayake emerge victorious at the Presidential election 2024. This is because they don't have a proper understanding on running the economy," Mr. Wijewardene told a ceremony held at UNP Sirikotha Headquarters to mark the 78th anniversary of the party.
