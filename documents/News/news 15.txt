Government behind the release of viral video clip, says Marikkar

Colombo, September 03 (Daily Mirror) -  Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP S. M. Marikkar today said that the viral video clip showing him having a discussion with President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been released by associates of the President himself.

“They have circulated this video over social media as Wickremesinghe is about to get politically bankrupt,” MP Marikkar told journalists.

“I met Mr. Wickremesinghe at a funeral in Piliyandala recently and he was talking about car permits. I said he could sign approvals for such permits as his capacity of being the finance minister. This is what happened,” he added.

“The red elephants are also taking a swipe at this clip and sharing it everywhere,” he also said.

Both Wickremesinghe and Marikkar are also seen criticizing the NPP in the clip.
