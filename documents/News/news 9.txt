Elon Musk’s Starlink launch withheld till Presidential Election is over

Colombo, September 07 (Daily Mirror) -  Sri Lanka’s plan to set up operations of Elon Musk's Starlink, the satellite unit of SpaceX, has been withheld till the Presidential Election is over because of some clearance pending with the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, a top source said.

State Minister of Technology, Kanaka Herath, announced earlier that the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission granted preliminary approval for ‘Starlink’ to provide satellite-based internet services in Sri Lanka.

Besides, Parliament approved amendments to a decades-old law on Tuesday to allow Elon Musk's Starlink to set up operations in the country.

Parliament passed the new telecommunications bill, which amended the existing law for the first time in 28 years, without a vote.

The amendments introduce three new types of licences and allow Starlink to enter Sri Lanka's telecom market as a licensed service provider.

However, a top government source said the launch would be impossible before the Presidential Elections. Sri Lankans will go to the polls on September 21 to decide on the next President to govern the country for another period of five years.

Once Starlink is launched, Elon Musk is also scheduled to visit Sri Lanka. Besides, the government authorities are planning for a Zoom meeting with Starlink.
