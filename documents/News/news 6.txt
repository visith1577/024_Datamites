EC bars voters from carrying mobile phones into polling stations

Colombo, September 12 (Daily Mirror) - Following the release of the image of a marked postal ballot paper to social media, the Election Commission has decided to bar voters from carrying their mobile phones inside polling stations at the presidential poll on September 21, an official said today.

Addressing a seminar organized by Sri Lanka Press Association themed ‘Media Role in Ensuring Free and Fair Presidential Election’, Commission’s Chairman R. M. A. L. Rathnayake said the person who released the marked postal ballot paper is now under arrest.

In a bid to arrest such a trend, he said the Commission will bar mobile phones into polling stations on September21.

“We have observed such a trend of marked ballot papers being released online during postal voting. We want to prevent that on the day of polling,” he said.

Commenting on the election, he said all preliminary arrangements for the conduct of polls had been made at the moment.

He said the media should ensure a level playing field for all the candidates in the fray.

He said the media should refrain from publishing unofficial results.

“We have 38 candidates in the fray. Each can ensure the presence of five agents in counting rooms Then it is a contested place. They crane their necks over counting officers and note results unofficially to be shared with their supporters. They cannot see properly at times. Their numbers sometimes don’t tally with official figures. So, people should not be misled with unofficial results,” he said.
