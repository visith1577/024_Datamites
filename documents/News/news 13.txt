Anura will overcome Sajith this year and become opposition leader: Ranil

The National People’s Power (NPP) Presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake will surpass Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) candidate Sajith Premadasa at this year’s Presidential polls and become the main opposition leader later this year, President Ranil Wickremesinghe believes.

Speaking at a rally in Mahiyangana, Wickremesinghe said that his former political protégé had failed in his duties as opposition leader, and thereby the SJB will fail to maintain its position as the main opposition.

“My party was the main opposition even during the time of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. There was only a two-way battle in the past. There was only one main candidate from the opposition and one from the ruling party during the Presidential elections in the past. However, it has changed today as there are two opposition candidates at this year’s presidential election,” Wickremesinghe said.

“They are Anura and Sajith. It is likely that Anura would overcome Sajith,” Wickremesinghe added, implying that he is the front-runner at this year's Presidential polls.
