UAE declares visa amnesty, Lankans urged to rectify residency status or return to Sri Lanka

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) government has launched a two-month amnesty scheme starting from September 1, 2024 which provides an opportunity for individuals to correct their visa status or return to their home countries without incurring fines or facing entry bans.

The Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Dubai requested that relatives of Sri Lankans living in the United Arab Emirates without legal residency permits to inform them of the opportunity given and make use of this time period to rectify their residency status or return to Sri Lanka under the amnesty granted.

In support of this amnesty, the Consulate General in Dubai has arranged special consular services for Sri Lankans from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, from Monday to Friday, in addition to the regular consular services conducted from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM daily while the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi has a special consular support programme running from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM, from Monday to Friday.

"According to the UAE Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP), the amnesty provisions extend to individuals born in the UAE without official documentation.

However, the amnesty does not apply to individuals who have entered the country illegally, those who have been previously deported or have deportation cases against them by the UAE or other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, as well as those who absconded from their employer after 01 September 2024," the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Dubai said.

Individuals who wish to exit the country must apply for an exit permit, which is valid for 14 days from the date of issue. If those who obtain exit permits do not depart within this period, previous fines and restrictions will be reinstated. Those who wish to remain in the country must regularize their visa status.

For further assistance, Sri Lankan nationals in the UAE are encouraged to visit the Consulate General in Dubai during the designated hours or contact the Consulate General for more information via the following channels:
