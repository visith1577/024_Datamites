Colombo, Sep 10 (Daily Mirror) - Around 80 SLPP MPs have booked tickets to leave the country because of President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s action of promoting NPP candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake, SJB MP Mujibur Rahman said.

"These MPs have decided to leave the country as they know that Wickremesinghe will not win the Presidential poll," MP Rahman added.

"Wickremesinghe seems to be promoting Anura Kumara Dissanayake and ensuring that the SJB candidate won't come to power," he further said.
