Jumbo threat to voters: election, wildlife authorities ready to deter elephants
In its bid to ensure that voters can reach polling stations safely on September 21, the election authorities have taken steps to liaise with the Department of Wildlife Conservation to prevent any threat from wild elephants, an official said.
In the electoral districts where human-elephant conflict prevails, the election authorities, as usual, fear whether voters will face any threat in reaching their respective polling stations located in the rural corners of the country.
Commissioner General of Elections Saman Sri Ratnayake told Daily Mirror that around 100 polling ststions in the Kurunegala electoral district face the threat of wild elephants. He said the election authorities of other districts are also alert after the identification of polling station areas prone to human-elephant conflicts.
“We are in touch with the wildlife authorities. Wildlife officers will be on standby with crackers in case a need arises to drive away elephants for voters to turn up safely at their polling stations to exercise their franchise,” he said.
He said this is a practice done every year. Also, he said wasp and hornet nests in some buildings to be used as polling stations had been removed to safeguard voters on polling day.
In addition, the election authorities coordinate with the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) to decide on steps to prevent any impact from natural disasters such as heavy rain, earth slips and landslides on the conduct of polling.
