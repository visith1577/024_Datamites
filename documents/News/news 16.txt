Mujibur rule out RW and SP reconciliation

Colombo, September 3 (Daily Mirror)- Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Mujibur Rahman today ruled out a possible political marriage between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa before the Presidential election.

"Some say that SJB will go for a political marriage between SJB and President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is far from the truth. There is no necessity for such a marriage as our candidate is ahead," MP Rahman said.

"President Wickremesinghe is being influenced by certain individuals, even to the point of altering his appearance,” he said.

“He has started wearing different shirts lately, which makes one wonder if a complete change in his attire is next," he remarked.
