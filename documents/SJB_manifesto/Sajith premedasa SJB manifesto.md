# Manifesto (Win for all)

My fellow Sri Lankans,

As we approach a defining moment in our nation’s political journey with the forthcoming Presidential election, I, Sajith Premadasa, proudly present this manifesto (Win for all), on behalf of the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) to outline our vision for a positive national transformation.

# Our Vision

The SJS is a new political force, with a vision to create a new Sri Lanka, by introducing a social market economy with social justice at its core. We believe a true democracy is one in which every citizen’s voice is heard.

Therefore, our manifesto & economic vision is not just about statistical growth but about tangible prosperity in every segment of society. We will create a resilient and inclusive economy, combining the strength of free markets with a deep commitment to equality, to ensure no Sri Lankan is left behind.

# Fight Against Corruption

Another crucial pillar of our vision is the fight against corruption. Corruption has long been a stain on Sri Lanka and has ultimately led us to bankruptcy, undermining trust in government and robbing our citizens. The future SJS government will root out corruption by embedding transparency and accountability in every aspect of governance with the necessary system reforms.

# Key Sectors

In our pursuit of prosperity, special attention will be provided to the crucial sectors of housing, healthcare and education. We will ensure every citizen can access quality housing. The healthcare sector, which is facing myriad crises, will be reinforced with professional and technological resources to create a healthy nation. The education sector will be revamped to build internationally competitive human capital, which can thrive in a rapidly changing world while contributing to the growth of Sri Lanka.

# Leadership

Throughout history, nations have been developed with strong team leadership. This is why the SJS has assembled the most qualified and pragmatic, team of politicians to ensure that the ambitious goals in this manifesto are achieved.

# Conclusion

Let me end by stating that the SJS is more than just a new alliance; it is a movement for much-needed change, driven by the belief that Sri Lanka can and must finally realize its true potential. I seek your support in this election not just for myself as your candidate but for the vision we all share for a stronger, fairer, and more prosperous nation. Let us come together to, finally, create the Sri Lanka we all deserve.

Sajith Premadasa

Leader

# BUILD A RESILIENT ECONOMY

We prioritize equitable growth through a Social Market Economy model, ensuring that the benefits of development reach all citizens. As we chart a course toward economic recovery and lasting prosperity, we pledge transparency, sustainability and empowerment creating a future where all can thrive.
---
# Sri Lanka's Economic Crisis

Sri Lanka is still facing its most severe economic crisis to date, caused by heavy debt, poor policy decisions, and weak governance. While recent steps have helped by lowering inflation and boosting foreign reserves, the road to full recovery and becoming an advanced economy remains extremely challenging. The average Sri Lankan has been forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, struggling with high prices and increased taxes and hopelessness.

# Social Market Economy Model

We will follow a Social Market Economy model guided by Social Democratic Political Principles to foster equitable and inclusive growth, harnessing the power of markets while ensuring social justice and protection for all. Our Blueprint 3.0 provides a strategic plan to tackle these challenges, rebuild the economy through strong growth, and secure a prosperous future for all. A key part of this plan is erasing corruption, a necessary but not a sufficient solution. Further, promote a green economy and environmental sustainability as foundational principles for economic growth and development.

# Sustainable Growth Approach

To achieve sustainable growth, we need a two-part approach: First, we must reform the economy to make it more competitive and globally connected. This will create wealth among the people. Second, we need to ensure economic justice and equity through a strong social safety net with targeted subsidies to protect the vulnerable. Additionally, we will aim to increase Gross National Happiness (GNH) by fostering a society where economic progress goes hand in hand with the well-being and overall happiness of our citizens.

# Transparency and Accountability

Introducing strong anti-corruption laws and strengthening the implementation of the current legal framework will speed up justice. The recovery of stolen assets and a robust programme to curb rampant corruption in the country’s administrative system shall be key. Establishing an independent Public Prosecutor’s Office free of political interference to bring to justice corrupt individuals will be done on an urgent basis by a simple amendment to legislation. We will enact a Public Procurement Law to guarantee procurement is conducted in a transparent, corruption-free and efficient manner. All government procurement shall be transferred to a digital platform.

To provide the consumer with the best quality and price, monopolistic and oligopolistic behavior will be corrected through the immediate introduction of a competition law.

We will bring in transparency in public finance management. There shall be full disclosure on expenditure plans and debt management strategies as well as in tax administration. The establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office would henceforth provide detailed analysis of all government tax and expenditure proposals.

# Managing the Debt Crisis and the IMF

We will strengthen fiscal discipline as per the IMF agreement and continue with difficult but necessary reforms to meet the targets of revenue, primary balance and debt. However, we will make amendments to the current programme to guarantee relief to those below poverty line and improve quality of life for Sri Lankans.

In the case of agreeing to a solution that allows for ‘claw back’ clauses for foreign creditors to benefit from more than expected GDP growth, we will insist that ‘comparability of treatment’ be extended to the EPF that bore the brunt of the domestic debt restructure.
---
# MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY

We will respect the autonomy of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) provided by the new Act but hold the bank fully accountable for meeting its inflation target. Furthermore, we will help ensure low and stable interest rates, an internationally competitive foreign exchange rate.

Widening the tax net. Certain identified items in addition to essential food as consumables and inputs shall be made zero rated for VAT.

Excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol and taxes on casinos will be adjusted to fund tax reductions.

A guaranteed up to 15% savings interest rate will be provided for senior citizen savings.

# ACHIEVING A REVENUE GROWTH

The solution to increase government revenue is not confined to raising taxes. One of our first acts will be to introduce digital technology to increase revenue, minimize expenditure and corruption. We will revise the unfair burden sharing structure of the IMF supported tax code revision that is forcing professionals to seek employment abroad.

Some highlights of our revised structure that will not disturb the overall revenue targets but will reduce the heavy burden on middle-class are:

- Personal income tax: Personal income tax after the Tax-free slab of Rs 100,000 per month will start at just 1% and increase up to 24% income up to around half a million per month. Thereafter, current rates will apply for high income earners.
- Corporate income tax: We intend reducing up to 6% from the present 30% rate for profits on exports and introduce 15% Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) minimum alternate tax for multinational companies.
- VAT: We intend to reduce VAT to 15% once tax compliance improves through the use of Public Digital Infrastructure.

# EXPENDITURE CONTROL

Although the IMF programme has focused on increasing revenue, it has not adequately addressed government expenditure control. Therefore, our economic vision aims to control wasteful government spending and corruption. This includes reforming state enterprises. Funds so saved will be utilized to implement a social safety net for the distressed population and to strengthen education and health sectors.

We will use data-based planning to control government expenditure and strengthen transparency and accountability of government spending to increase public trust.

# STIMULATING ECONOMIC GROWTH

Our government will be committed to transforming Sri Lanka into a globally connected social market economy, with private enterprise, both large and small, as the principal driver of growth. This transformation requires two key actions: enhancing global economic integration through trade liberalization and foreign direct investment and unshackling domestic markets, including product and labor markets. Ensuring effective market signals will enable full private sector engagement in national development.
---
# AGRICULTURAL REFORMS

We shall address challenges at multiple levels. Archaic laws need modernization. Reforms will unshackle agriculture markets, provide equitable water access through rehabilitated irrigation tanks, and offer access to finance and insurance. For the individual farmer, the entire value chain—from obtaining information on what, how much, and when to produce, to financing inputs and managing the cultivation cycle—needs improvement. Thereafter, post-harvest management in terms of storage to logistics to sale must be addressed.

We will implement a rapid, smart technology-driven agricultural modernization programme to reduce rural poverty, increase productivity, and promote sector growth. This includes interventions – in paddy, vegetable, and plantation crops – from planting to sale, like protected agriculture, lift irrigation, drip irrigation, and perhaps even AI-assisted hydroponic farming. This effort will become possible with the launching of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).

To reduce and maintain the price of rice we will reintroduce the ‘Shakthi’ rice miller nation-wide cooperative programme. We will also immediately establish ‘Prabhashwara’, a network of climate-controlled agricultural produce warehouses around the country to reduce the 40% post-harvest loss of produce. This too will contribute to lowering the price of food.

# INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT: CONNECTING TO THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN

Sri Lanka will be connected to Global Manufacturing Value Chains (GMVCs) starting with manufacturing sliced components utilizing the still untapped trainable workforce and our strategic location. Here, we plan to integrate with global electronic and electrical goods production as well as in EV components using transformation of critical material including graphite. Our government will also be committed to further advancing the success of the apparel sector.

# SERVICES: A KEY DRIVER OF VALUE CREATION

A key component of the growth plan is the service sector. We will focus on e-commerce and information technology services and in transforming Sri Lanka into a logistics service center.

# MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSMES) AND THE STARTUP ECO SYSTEM

MSMEs and start-ups are as important as the large corporates in driving economic growth contributing to approximately half of value addition and half of employment. MSMEs have been long neglected and currently in crisis, particularly since the pandemic and then the economic meltdown. Our government will place special emphasis in rescuing and setting a path for MSMEs to become a key contributor to the expected high growth trajectory of Sri Lanka through access to digitization, capital and programmes for training.

# PORT CITY

We will amend the law to make the Port City the Asian Regional Centre for technology services including Fintech, Biotech and Nanotech.

# PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND DIGITALIZATION

Efficient and equitable public provision of health, education and social services is vital for economic development and civil security. Sri Lanka’s public sector is responsible for providing these services. Yet although
---
It is massive it is plagued by overlapping roles, redundancy, and underpayment. Decades of reform have failed to address corruption and accountability issues, from public procurement to service delivery. We plan to overhaul the public service through digitalization and introducing key performance indicators to enhance productivity. This will improve management, transparency and efficiency while minimizing corruption.

# 1. Establishing a SOE Holding Company

Establishing a SOE Holding Company is a key part of state-owned enterprise reform. This SOE Holding Company will provide a centralised and strategic framework for managing SOE ownership, under a structure like Singapore’s ‘Temasek model’. What shareholding the State shall hold in each of the SOEs shall be determined based on multiple objectives of the various stakeholders, balancing national security interests with international competitiveness and efficiency.

# 2. Building a Digital Health Public Infrastructure to Increase Efficiency in the Public Sector

Health sector will be transformed with high-tech solutions from drug procurement to all health services. Lessons learnt in using digital technology in ‘1990 Suwa Seriya’ being classified one of the world’s most advanced and fastest ambulance services, will be incorporated into enhancing quality and efficiency.

# 3. Energy and Utility Reforms

Our approach in power and energy will focus on implementing transparent, automated systems that minimize individual discretion, close loopholes for manipulation, and eliminate the incentives for ‘dealmakers’ to push unsolicited proposals.

While creating competition in generation and distribution is necessary, consumers and industry should not bear the burden of high energy costs due to monopoly power and inefficiency. We support cost-reflective electricity tariffs, but these costs must exclude corruption and inefficiency in power purchase agreements.

We will reassess the proposed structure in the new Act and recommend amendments to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the reform process. Our priorities include establishing a fair electricity market, safeguarding consumer interests, improving accountability and depoliticizing the industry.

We envision not just meeting but exceeding the target of 70% renewable energy generation by 2030, aiming to make Sri Lanka a regional renewable energy powerhouse.

# 4. Reforming the Market of Factors of Production

We shall implement factor market reforms by relaxing restrictions on land, labor, and capital markets to facilitate doing business in Sri Lanka and promote both domestic and foreign investments. Our government is committed to implementing a national land reforms programme aimed at improving land productivity and securing land rights. A key priority will be the creation of a digital land registry, completing the ongoing “Bim Saviya” programme.

Recognizing the importance of human capital development, we will prioritize policies aimed at improving educational outcomes, developing job-relevant skills, and fostering innovation. Enhancing the quality and accessibility of education is crucial to building a competitive workforce.
---
# Programmes will be implemented to ensure

that Sri Lanka’s workforce possesses the skills necessary for the jobs of tomorrow. We will swiftly implement reforms to boost capital inflows and strengthen the domestic capital market. Key regulations will be reformed to enhance foreign direct investment (FDI) to stimulate economic growth and support existing investors.
